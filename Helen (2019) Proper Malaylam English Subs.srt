00:03:02,291 --> 00:03:03,291
Hi.

2
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,708
My name is Helen Paul.

3
00:03:06,541 --> 00:03:08,500
I am 25 years old.

4
00:03:09,625 --> 00:03:11,208
I live with my father.

5
00:03:12,833 --> 00:03:14,833
I am nursing...

6
00:03:14,875 --> 00:03:15,875
No.. Err...

7
00:03:16,208 --> 00:03:18,541
I am a B.Sc. Nursing....

8
00:03:20,166 --> 00:03:21,916
I am a B.Sc. Nursing graduate.

9
00:03:26,791 --> 00:03:27,666
Oops.

10
00:03:29,958 --> 00:03:37,458
'Who are you, searching
for an unseen shore?'

11
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:45,041
'A lovely dove,
or the eye of a beautiful butterfly?'

12
00:03:45,375 --> 00:03:52,791
'Who are you, searching
for an unseen shore?'

13
00:03:53,208 --> 00:04:00,708
'A lovely dove,
or the eye of a beautiful butterfly?'

14
00:04:00,791 --> 00:04:08,416
'This life... is beautiful'

15
00:04:08,458 --> 00:04:16,291
'It's beautiful...
It's beautiful'

16
00:04:16,333 --> 00:04:23,416
'Who are you, searching
for an unseen shore?'

17
00:04:24,041 --> 00:04:31,583
'A lovely dove,
or the eye of a beautiful butterfly?'

18
00:04:31,625 --> 00:04:38,333
'This life... is beautiful'

19
00:04:39,416 --> 00:04:47,000
'It's beautiful...
It's beautiful'

20
00:04:47,291 --> 00:04:54,333
'Solace... A solace'

21
00:04:55,041 --> 00:05:02,041
'My heart is waiting for it'

22
00:05:20,583 --> 00:05:22,041
Tea is in the table.

23
00:05:22,875 --> 00:05:24,041
It's 'on', not 'in', right?

24
00:05:24,333 --> 00:05:26,041
Would anyone keep tea 'in'?

25
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:28,625
Tea is on the table.
Okay.

26
00:05:28,625 --> 00:05:31,500
Tea is on the table. - Learn it by
saying without looking at the book.

27
00:05:31,583 --> 00:05:32,583
Yeah!

28
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:37,208
Since you didn't send me to an English
Medium school, expect only this much!

29
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:38,250
Yeah right!

30
00:05:38,291 --> 00:05:40,000
Do you know about KR Narayanan?

31
00:05:40,041 --> 00:05:42,750
KR Narayanan studied in a Govt. school,
& became India's President, right?

32
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:43,750
I've heard that!

33
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:46,000
So you know that.

34
00:05:46,041 --> 00:05:48,958
Stop giggling and finish your bath.
It's time for me to leave.

35
00:05:49,333 --> 00:05:51,500
So Papa, 'Tea is on the table'.
Okay?

36
00:05:56,583 --> 00:05:58,041
Papa...
- What is it?

37
00:05:58,166 --> 00:05:59,375
Are you smoking?

38
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,375
You flushed the cigarette, right?

39
00:06:02,541 --> 00:06:03,541
Cigarette, it seems!

40
00:06:03,625 --> 00:06:05,166
I just flushed, like I do usually.

41
00:06:05,208 --> 00:06:06,750
Then why are you
still sitting there?

42
00:06:06,875 --> 00:06:08,083
Sigh! This girl!!

43
00:06:08,166 --> 00:06:09,291
Don't try to cover up.

44
00:06:09,375 --> 00:06:10,958
What will happen if you smoke?

45
00:06:12,666 --> 00:06:13,666
Papa!

46
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:16,166
Smoking increases?

47
00:06:16,208 --> 00:06:17,833
Increases blood pleasure..
Then...

48
00:06:17,875 --> 00:06:19,083
Not pleasure.
Pressure.

49
00:06:19,166 --> 00:06:20,833
Can't even say it properly.
Say the rest.

50
00:06:20,958 --> 00:06:23,750
... and can lead to heart
attack and cancer.

51
00:06:23,791 --> 00:06:24,791
That means?

52
00:06:25,875 --> 00:06:27,666
I know!
- Then tell me.

53
00:06:28,875 --> 00:06:30,166
I'll be dead!

54
00:06:30,208 --> 00:06:32,208
So it's not because
you don't know that.

55
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:35,125
Going to the bathroom with the
phone has become a habit now?

56
00:06:35,166 --> 00:06:36,166
No...

57
00:06:36,333 --> 00:06:38,458
I got a great prayer
of Mother Mary.

58
00:06:38,791 --> 00:06:41,458
If I send it to 25 people,
our wishes would come true.

59
00:06:41,791 --> 00:06:43,041
I sent it to 20 people.

60
00:06:43,166 --> 00:06:45,666
Just 5 more people left.
- Oh Papa! - Let me try it, dear.

61
00:06:45,833 --> 00:06:47,375
I'll give you 5
minutes to get ready.

62
00:06:48,833 --> 00:06:50,458
Buying that phone for
him was a mistake.

63
00:06:51,833 --> 00:06:52,875
Get ready quickly!

64
00:06:52,916 --> 00:06:54,041
Hi Chechi.
- Hi.

65
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:57,791
Sumechi...

66
00:06:59,791 --> 00:07:00,833
Seems like you got
your chit fund?

67
00:07:00,875 --> 00:07:02,958
It looks great.
Okay. Shall I go?

68
00:07:07,416 --> 00:07:09,708
Raghavetta, good morning.
- Good morning.

69
00:07:10,166 --> 00:07:11,583
Wow! Hogging nicely, huh?

70
00:07:11,583 --> 00:07:12,750
No, dear.

71
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:14,166
I'm done.

72
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:17,166
Don't you have class today?
- No. I have study leave.

73
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:20,833
Dear...

74
00:07:20,875 --> 00:07:23,000
Tell me if any of mother's
medicines have run out.

75
00:07:23,166 --> 00:07:24,208
I will.

76
00:07:26,916 --> 00:07:27,958
Very nice.

77
00:07:27,958 --> 00:07:30,708
Your Arthritis isn't getting cured,
because you keep walking barefoot.

78
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:32,416
You never obey what I say.

79
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:35,250
You could have come
after 5 minutes.

80
00:07:35,958 --> 00:07:38,416
When it's 9 o'clock, my heart
starts beating faster.

81
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:42,375
You gave birth to 5 children, but
you're still scared of a needle?

82
00:07:42,541 --> 00:07:43,541
It will be done now.

83
00:07:43,666 --> 00:07:45,458
Slowly.
- I'll do it slowly.

84
00:07:47,083 --> 00:07:48,125
It's done.

85
00:07:48,166 --> 00:07:49,166
Okay.

86
00:07:51,916 --> 00:07:53,666
Hey!
Come and sit here.

87
00:07:53,708 --> 00:07:55,583
No. I don't have time to sit.
What's the matter?

88
00:07:55,708 --> 00:07:57,416
You're running around so much!

89
00:07:57,458 --> 00:07:59,041
Razel tablets are over, okay?

90
00:07:59,333 --> 00:08:00,916
Stop beating around the bush.

91
00:08:01,625 --> 00:08:03,458
Paul had come here yesterday.

92
00:08:04,125 --> 00:08:07,166
Hey! If you've taken up any task
from Papa, don't try it with me.

93
00:08:07,958 --> 00:08:10,625
He doesn't like you
going to Canada at all.

94
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:12,958
Do I really wish to live
in some unknown country?

95
00:08:13,083 --> 00:08:15,375
That house is under
my name just for now.

96
00:08:15,583 --> 00:08:18,458
The bank keeps calling to ask whether
they can make it under their name.

97
00:08:18,708 --> 00:08:21,000
Then why don't you
do this job here?

98
00:08:21,416 --> 00:08:24,250
Even after doing so many protests,
nurses are still paid peanuts here.

99
00:08:24,333 --> 00:08:26,000
That won't solve our problem.

100
00:08:27,833 --> 00:08:30,416
And yeah, I have some other
intentions in going there, as well.

101
00:08:30,791 --> 00:08:31,833
What?

102
00:08:31,833 --> 00:08:35,083
In Canada, there's a huge demand for
people above 70's like you, Devammal.

103
00:08:35,083 --> 00:08:38,166
Let me see if I can set you up with a
handsome foreigner after getting there.

104
00:08:40,583 --> 00:08:44,208
He was lazing around for so long.
Once he's ready, he'll start hurrying.

105
00:08:44,625 --> 00:08:46,458
'Helen!', he'll call now.

106
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:48,291
Helen!
- The call has come.

107
00:08:48,333 --> 00:08:49,541
Shall I leave?
- Okay.

108
00:08:50,041 --> 00:08:51,583
Hey!
- What?

109
00:08:52,083 --> 00:08:54,666
Don't look for grumpy old men.

110
00:08:55,416 --> 00:08:57,791
Someone around 50-60 years old.
- Look at you!

111
00:08:57,791 --> 00:09:00,500
Look at your smile! Let me see if
you'd be around till next Christmas!

112
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:01,500
Okay.
Bye.

113
00:09:02,666 --> 00:09:04,458
Come home in the evening.
We'll have a drink.

114
00:09:04,791 --> 00:09:07,333
Not today. I'll come tomorrow.
I'll be late today.

115
00:09:07,416 --> 00:09:10,375
There's auditing... - Raghavetta,
Papa's quota for this month is over.

116
00:09:10,458 --> 00:09:11,666
Not me.
It was your Papa!

117
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:13,041
Great! Me?
- Whoever it is!

118
00:09:13,541 --> 00:09:15,291
There's no time for
your make-up now!

119
00:09:15,333 --> 00:09:16,333
I'm going to get my bag.

120
00:09:16,458 --> 00:09:18,166
Wipe off that mortar
from your neck first.

121
00:09:26,291 --> 00:09:28,500
It's not mortar.
It's Cuticura (talcum powder).

122
00:09:31,666 --> 00:09:32,875
Are you coming or not?

123
00:09:39,458 --> 00:09:40,500
Let's go.

124
00:09:40,541 --> 00:09:42,083
Switched off the gas cylinder?
- Yes.

125
00:09:42,708 --> 00:09:43,875
No. Wait.

126
00:09:44,833 --> 00:09:46,000
I get confused when you ask!

127
00:09:46,375 --> 00:09:47,500
As soon as I said...

128
00:09:47,666 --> 00:09:49,250
Hey!
- I'll be right back.

129
00:09:49,625 --> 00:09:50,916
[mumbling]

130
00:09:51,916 --> 00:09:55,041
Papa, had you gone to
Raghavettan's house yesterday?

131
00:09:55,208 --> 00:09:56,208
What?

132
00:09:56,333 --> 00:09:57,625
Raghavettan's house?
- No.

133
00:09:57,708 --> 00:09:58,750
I didn't go there!

134
00:09:59,083 --> 00:10:00,625
I'll punch you if you lie to me.

135
00:10:01,041 --> 00:10:04,458
Neighbours would keep going to
each other's houses. So what?

136
00:10:04,583 --> 00:10:07,500
Counting this, it's the sixth
person to speak for you, to me.

137
00:10:08,666 --> 00:10:10,958
Mr. Paul, shall I ask you something?

138
00:10:12,041 --> 00:10:14,416
For roaming all around town to
grab a few insurance policies,

139
00:10:14,416 --> 00:10:15,791
how much do you
get in a month?

140
00:10:15,791 --> 00:10:17,000
Why do you want to know?

141
00:10:17,625 --> 00:10:21,125
Why am I going for this part-time job,
when I have no time after the IELTS class?

142
00:10:22,125 --> 00:10:23,708
To get rid of your boredom.
Why else?

143
00:10:23,958 --> 00:10:24,958
Papa!

144
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:26,583
What do you want now?

145
00:10:26,833 --> 00:10:28,750
You want to go to Canada.
Go!

146
00:10:28,833 --> 00:10:31,916
Leaving your Papa alone here,
go to Canada, America, wherever.

147
00:10:31,916 --> 00:10:32,916
Problem solved?

148
00:10:33,208 --> 00:10:36,416
Long back when you went to the Middle East,
Mummy & me were all alone, right?

149
00:10:36,666 --> 00:10:38,208
Did I go there to have fun?

150
00:10:38,416 --> 00:10:42,000
Staying in the damn hot sun there, I
lost all my fairness. Do you know that?

151
00:10:42,041 --> 00:10:43,416
That's what I also said.

152
00:10:43,791 --> 00:10:44,791
What?

153
00:10:45,125 --> 00:10:46,500
That I'm not going
there to have fun.

154
00:10:46,541 --> 00:10:49,916
Yeah right! As if I need
you to make money for me!

155
00:10:56,041 --> 00:10:57,250
Stop here.

156
00:10:59,458 --> 00:11:00,458
Get down.

157
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:04,208
How much, sir?
- For 110 Rupees.

158
00:11:08,416 --> 00:11:09,416
Who's on the phone?

159
00:11:09,958 --> 00:11:11,250
It's Shahina, Papa.

160
00:11:11,666 --> 00:11:12,791
Why don't you pick up then?

161
00:11:13,416 --> 00:11:14,583
It's a petrol bunk, right?

162
00:11:15,708 --> 00:11:18,291
Why can't you be friends
with our people?

163
00:11:18,458 --> 00:11:19,708
By our people, you mean?

164
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,875
We're first class pure Christians.

165
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:24,875
Which era are you
living in, Papa?

166
00:11:28,625 --> 00:11:29,625
Here.

167
00:11:29,708 --> 00:11:30,708
Okay, sir.

168
00:11:31,083 --> 00:11:34,291
Papa, don't tell me that you didn't
see the missed call like yesterday.

169
00:11:34,416 --> 00:11:36,041
Your phone is not on
silent mode, is it?

170
00:11:36,208 --> 00:11:38,666
When you see the missed call, have
the 'before food' medicine at noon.

171
00:11:38,708 --> 00:11:39,750
I know!

172
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:42,125
I should have the rest of the medicines
after food. That's all, right?

173
00:11:42,125 --> 00:11:43,458
Balance.
Okay, sir.

174
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:45,750
When you go to Canada...

175
00:11:46,291 --> 00:11:48,708
this will be difficult. When it's
night there, it will be day here.

176
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:49,875
You know, right?

177
00:11:50,041 --> 00:11:52,416
I'll set an alarm to wake up, okay?
- Okay.

178
00:11:52,875 --> 00:11:55,875
There are many children who
leave saying all this, dear.

179
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,458
Let's wait and see.
- Are you saying that I'm like that?

180
00:11:58,916 --> 00:12:00,416
I just said generally.

181
00:12:00,625 --> 00:12:01,625
What?

182
00:12:01,625 --> 00:12:03,583
I was just speaking generally.

183
00:12:08,958 --> 00:12:09,958
Oh God!

184
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:11,250
Shall I go?

185
00:12:12,458 --> 00:12:13,666
Okay then.
- Hey!

186
00:12:13,791 --> 00:12:14,791
Come here.
- What?

187
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,333
How's that friend
of yours, Shahina?

188
00:12:17,375 --> 00:12:18,833
Can you convince her
to get a policy?

189
00:12:18,958 --> 00:12:21,333
Oh no! Shahina is not among
our people, right Papa?

190
00:12:21,333 --> 00:12:24,083
You can convince many true
Christians to get policies, right?

191
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:26,375
Go! Go!
- Okay.

192
00:12:34,541 --> 00:12:35,583
Did you get the date?

193
00:12:35,625 --> 00:12:38,083
No! I'm taking it slowly.
I failed twice. I can't repeat it.

194
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:41,500
Everything else is okay. But sitting in
front of those idiots for 'Speaking'...

195
00:12:41,583 --> 00:12:42,958
I don't understand a
word of what they say.

196
00:12:43,083 --> 00:12:44,500
Just watch English movies for that.

197
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:47,125
My family won't let me watch them,
since they have adult content.

198
00:12:47,125 --> 00:12:49,583
Great! Hey! Let me go.
It's time for my bus.

199
00:12:49,708 --> 00:12:50,791
It's time for my bus.
Bye.

200
00:12:58,666 --> 00:13:00,708
Madam, please have a
look here and go!

201
00:13:03,333 --> 00:13:04,333
Hello!

202
00:13:04,458 --> 00:13:05,750
I can drop you in the evening!

203
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:26,250
Jins, why can't you check this stock?

204
00:13:26,666 --> 00:13:28,666
We have to supply the
stock to 4 stores!

205
00:13:28,833 --> 00:13:30,250
What will I say,
when they call me?

206
00:13:30,458 --> 00:13:32,041
Sir, we'll get it
ready from tomorrow.

207
00:13:34,041 --> 00:13:35,875
We can get the stock
ready from tomorrow.

208
00:13:36,416 --> 00:13:37,416
What did you say now?

209
00:13:37,541 --> 00:13:38,541
From tomorrow...

210
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:41,541
Don't even utter the
word 'tomorrow'.

211
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:43,250
Understood?

212
00:13:46,125 --> 00:13:47,125
Tomorrow, it seems.

213
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:49,291
Wipe it!
- I'm wiping, sir.

214
00:13:53,708 --> 00:13:54,708
Hi.

215
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:56,041
Wait.
- What happened?

216
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:58,500
Oops.
Sorry sir!

217
00:13:59,625 --> 00:14:01,000
Are you playing billiards here?

218
00:14:01,208 --> 00:14:02,333
No, sir.
- Do what I said!

219
00:14:04,791 --> 00:14:05,791
Do it.

220
00:14:05,958 --> 00:14:08,250
You guys think you can fool me.
- No, sir.

221
00:14:08,291 --> 00:14:10,875
Not a fly would move here,
without this Jayashankar's knowledge.

222
00:14:10,916 --> 00:14:12,041
Do your work, man!

223
00:14:16,875 --> 00:14:18,166
Hi. Your order, sir?

224
00:14:20,625 --> 00:14:28,083
'Who are you, searching
for an unseen shore?'

225
00:14:28,333 --> 00:14:36,125
'A lovely dove,
or the eye of a beautiful butterfly?'

226
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:43,375
'Who are you, searching
for an unseen shore?'

227
00:14:44,125 --> 00:14:45,541
Why don't you guys learn?

228
00:14:45,583 --> 00:14:47,375
You should learn how to
deal with customers.

229
00:14:47,541 --> 00:14:49,416
I will learn, sir.
- Excuse me.

230
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Yes, sir.

231
00:14:51,625 --> 00:14:54,875
Is your chicken in-house,
or is it from outside?

232
00:14:56,583 --> 00:14:57,583
Watch!

233
00:14:58,208 --> 00:15:00,583
Sir, our poultry farm
is at Thodupuzha.

234
00:15:01,458 --> 00:15:03,583
Then coming in small small
auto rickshaws and trucks.

235
00:15:04,333 --> 00:15:05,541
Our chicken is...

236
00:15:05,625 --> 00:15:07,416
soft, gentle...

237
00:15:08,458 --> 00:15:09,583
... and crispy too!

238
00:15:10,041 --> 00:15:11,500
That's not what I asked.

239
00:15:14,458 --> 00:15:18,333
Isn't this why I told you for so long, that
you should learn to deal with customers?

240
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:21,000
Sir, he is the right person.

241
00:15:23,416 --> 00:15:26,375
Is your chicken in-house,
or is it from outside?

242
00:15:27,333 --> 00:15:29,625
What?
Sir, is there a problem?

243
00:15:29,708 --> 00:15:33,791
I just wanted to ask if the chicken
is in-house or if it's from outside.

244
00:15:34,041 --> 00:15:36,250
Sir, all the chicken are
from own poultry farm.

245
00:15:36,291 --> 00:15:38,125
We don't use anything
from outside.

246
00:15:38,666 --> 00:15:39,916
Okay.
That's good.

247
00:15:40,041 --> 00:15:41,041
Sir, your bill?

248
00:15:41,291 --> 00:15:43,291
Thank you.
Your English is so good.

249
00:15:43,333 --> 00:15:44,333
Thank you, sir.

250
00:15:44,416 --> 00:15:52,083
'This life... is beautiful'

251
00:15:52,250 --> 00:16:00,000
'It's beautiful...
It's beautiful'

252
00:16:00,041 --> 00:16:07,500
'This life... is beautiful'

253
00:16:07,541 --> 00:16:15,000
'It's beautiful...
It's beautiful'

254
00:16:16,041 --> 00:16:17,375
Hello, good evening.
Chicken Hub!

255
00:16:17,416 --> 00:16:18,625
Can I take your order, please?

256
00:16:18,666 --> 00:16:21,250
Helen, forgive me.
Forgive me this one time. Please.

257
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:22,458
Sorry sir.
Out of stock.

258
00:16:25,625 --> 00:16:26,625
Is it Azhar?

259
00:16:27,958 --> 00:16:29,750
What's the problem this time?

260
00:16:30,458 --> 00:16:33,041
Chechi, people should have some
kind of responsibility, right?

261
00:16:33,166 --> 00:16:36,250
He had a job interview yesterday also,
and he want to play ball instead.

262
00:16:36,458 --> 00:16:38,083
And he lied to me
that he went for it.

263
00:16:38,583 --> 00:16:39,916
My dear...

264
00:16:40,083 --> 00:16:42,250
Didn't you say that you saw
him for the first time,

265
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:44,708
when he was brought to the hospital
with injuries after a fight?

266
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:47,833
I have no idea how you fell
in love with him then!

267
00:16:48,916 --> 00:16:50,875
Chechi, from my experience,

268
00:16:51,041 --> 00:16:52,583
when someone gets a
strong injection,

269
00:16:52,625 --> 00:16:55,625
if he cries 'Mummy' instead of 'Oh no!',
he should be decent.

270
00:16:55,916 --> 00:16:57,791
You are crazy, girl.

271
00:16:58,541 --> 00:17:01,291
We just had a small fight now.
We will solve it soon.

272
00:17:02,125 --> 00:17:03,916
After all, who is perfect?

273
00:17:04,291 --> 00:17:06,625
Don't you and Prakashettan fight?

274
00:17:07,083 --> 00:17:08,583
You're the one spoiling him!

275
00:17:08,666 --> 00:17:10,166
You'll learn when
you get married!

276
00:17:10,291 --> 00:17:11,625
See, when I spoke
about Prakashettan...

277
00:17:11,625 --> 00:17:13,041
People are coming.
Get the bill.

278
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:15,500
Hi Ma'am. Can I take your order?

279
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:17,458
One Zinger burger.

280
00:17:21,291 --> 00:17:22,333
Sir...

281
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:25,125
Doesn't this have any butter?
- Sorry sir. We're low on butter.

282
00:17:25,125 --> 00:17:26,625
But the bill isn't low, right?

283
00:17:26,791 --> 00:17:27,791
Sorry sir.

284
00:17:28,958 --> 00:17:30,791
Have you come to eat this,
or watch the movie?

285
00:17:30,833 --> 00:17:32,708
I had stopped watching
English movies with you.

286
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:34,000
But this one's 3D, right?

287
00:17:34,166 --> 00:17:36,625
I really wanted to watch 'My Dear
Kuttichathan' when I was young.

288
00:17:36,666 --> 00:17:38,541
I was bedridden,
after falling from a tree then.

289
00:17:39,208 --> 00:17:41,875
It had released again some years back,
right? Why didn't you watch then?

290
00:17:41,916 --> 00:17:44,916
Great! That was when your
mother was in the hospital.

291
00:17:45,083 --> 00:17:48,875
What would people say if I watch a movie
wearing 3D glasses in between that?

292
00:17:48,958 --> 00:17:51,625
So your problem is what people would say,
and not watching the movie, huh?

293
00:17:51,666 --> 00:17:54,375
Not just that. With the hospital expenses,
I was really tight then.

294
00:17:54,625 --> 00:17:56,500
Hey! I can't see anything,
after wearing this.

295
00:17:56,541 --> 00:17:58,583
Wear the glasses only
when the movie starts.

296
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:00,458
Then why don't they give it then?

297
00:18:00,625 --> 00:18:02,958
Hey! Explain the dialogues which
I can't understand, okay?

298
00:18:02,958 --> 00:18:04,416
There would be
subtitles below.

299
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:05,416
Get in.

300
00:18:06,125 --> 00:18:08,125
By the time I read that,
the visuals would go off.

301
00:18:08,541 --> 00:18:09,541
Sorry.

302
00:18:14,583 --> 00:18:16,166
This place isn't cool enough.
- Hello!

303
00:18:16,208 --> 00:18:17,208
Who is it, with you?

304
00:18:18,916 --> 00:18:20,125
What?
- Well...

305
00:18:20,125 --> 00:18:21,458
I was asking if
you were her dad.

306
00:18:24,416 --> 00:18:25,500
Sit there, dear.

307
00:18:34,041 --> 00:18:35,333
What all does he want to know?

308
00:18:35,916 --> 00:18:37,625
I'm not her dad.
I'm her elder son.

309
00:18:44,375 --> 00:18:45,916
You can't forgive me, huh?

310
00:18:47,041 --> 00:18:48,166
Shall I tell Papa?

311
00:18:48,166 --> 00:18:49,416
Azhar, what are you doing here?

312
00:18:50,083 --> 00:18:51,166
Then what else should I do?

313
00:18:52,083 --> 00:18:53,250
I can't forgive you.
Get lost.

314
00:18:54,083 --> 00:18:56,083
You haven't picked up the phone for 3 days.
- The movie is starting.

315
00:18:56,666 --> 00:18:57,875
This man!!

316
00:19:01,208 --> 00:19:03,916
Azhar, please go.
- I won't go.

317
00:19:04,416 --> 00:19:06,375
Let Papa know who
your Shahina is.

318
00:19:07,375 --> 00:19:09,416
If you don't forgive me,
I'll fall at your feet now.

319
00:19:09,458 --> 00:19:10,958
Don't fall at my feet.
Papa is here.

320
00:19:13,458 --> 00:19:14,791
Then say that
you've forgiven me.

321
00:19:14,833 --> 00:19:16,083
Okay. I forgive you.

322
00:19:18,666 --> 00:19:19,666
Really?

323
00:19:19,916 --> 00:19:20,916
Yes. Really.

324
00:19:22,166 --> 00:19:23,166
Shall I go then?

325
00:19:23,375 --> 00:19:24,375
Yeah! Go!

326
00:19:27,916 --> 00:19:29,666
What now?
- Well...

327
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:32,125
Say 'I love you' once.

328
00:19:32,625 --> 00:19:33,625
Get lost!

329
00:19:34,333 --> 00:19:35,500
Hey! What did he say now?

330
00:19:36,666 --> 00:19:37,958
Just said 'I love you', sir.

331
00:19:39,458 --> 00:19:40,458
Between two dolls?

332
00:19:41,083 --> 00:19:44,000
This is what.
These English movies don't have any logic!

333
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:45,916
Telugu is the best for that!

334
00:20:08,208 --> 00:20:15,250
'O golden star,
can you spread your golden sheen?'

335
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:22,833
'O sky, will you look at the
mirror to see her beauty?'

336
00:20:24,291 --> 00:20:25,291
Helen!

337
00:20:27,291 --> 00:20:29,625
Get me that remote!

338
00:20:30,791 --> 00:20:31,791
Helen!

339
00:20:32,041 --> 00:20:34,416
What?
- Switch on that fan!

340
00:20:35,666 --> 00:20:36,708
Helen!

341
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:38,916
Just scratch my back for me!

342
00:20:38,958 --> 00:20:39,958
Your back, huh?

343
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:44,958
'O golden star,
can you spread your golden sheen?'

344
00:20:45,125 --> 00:20:52,416
'O sky, will you look at the mirror?'

345
00:20:54,291 --> 00:20:55,416
Always on the phone?

346
00:20:55,875 --> 00:20:57,500
There was a WhatsApp
message from NASA,

347
00:20:57,541 --> 00:21:00,541
that cosmic rays would be passing
through the sky, tonight after 2 AM.

348
00:21:00,583 --> 00:21:02,833
You shouldn't be so careless about it.
Go to sleep!

349
00:21:22,458 --> 00:21:29,375
'Without taking away the smile on her
face and the scent on her cheeks,

350
00:21:29,416 --> 00:21:35,625
will you go by, O breeze?'

351
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:50,750
'Can you sing lullabies for her,
in a different tune, every day?'

352
00:21:51,416 --> 00:21:55,583
'O girl who casts a net with
colours and a magical mind'

353
00:21:55,625 --> 00:22:00,541
'Love showers within you,
like an endless rain, O star'

354
00:22:00,583 --> 00:22:05,791
'O beauty'

355
00:22:06,333 --> 00:22:13,375
'O golden star,
can you spread your golden sheen?'

356
00:22:13,666 --> 00:22:15,916
'O sky...'

357
00:22:17,083 --> 00:22:18,291
Smile, Papa!

358
00:22:20,958 --> 00:22:28,208
'You should shine endlessly,
in the flame of smiles'

359
00:22:28,291 --> 00:22:35,750
'Dreams should spread,
like sprouting flowers'

360
00:22:35,833 --> 00:22:42,833
'O golden star,
can you spread your golden sheen?'

361
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:50,333
'O sky, will you look at the
mirror to see her beauty?'

362
00:23:31,541 --> 00:23:32,916
Hey 'Light that never goes out'!

363
00:23:32,958 --> 00:23:35,083
Get lost!
Mess with your own kind!

364
00:23:35,125 --> 00:23:36,125
Your daughter is coming.

365
00:23:46,041 --> 00:23:48,125
Littu, dear.
How are you doing?

366
00:23:48,291 --> 00:23:50,166
Great, uncle.
- Good.

367
00:23:50,208 --> 00:23:52,625
Hey! Seems like he's
really happy today.

368
00:23:52,666 --> 00:23:54,166
He's hiding something.

369
00:23:55,083 --> 00:23:56,375
Okay. Bye.
- Bye.

370
00:23:57,041 --> 00:23:58,541
Uncle, I'm leaving.

371
00:23:59,291 --> 00:24:02,583
'The way you look at me,
oh my God'

372
00:24:03,541 --> 00:24:04,750
What to say, right?

373
00:24:05,041 --> 00:24:07,583
'The way you look at me,
oh my God'

374
00:24:07,958 --> 00:24:08,958
What?

375
00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:16,875
Come.

376
00:24:18,916 --> 00:24:19,916
What is this?

377
00:24:20,666 --> 00:24:21,666
Well...

378
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,666
[mumbling]

379
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:25,500
That...

380
00:24:26,041 --> 00:24:27,041
I...

381
00:24:31,708 --> 00:24:33,083
Place your hand on it.

382
00:24:33,375 --> 00:24:34,541
Why?

383
00:24:34,916 --> 00:24:36,125
Place your hand, I say.

384
00:24:39,250 --> 00:24:40,875
Now give me all the
cigarettes you have.

385
00:24:46,166 --> 00:24:48,625
That's all? Where are you taking your hand?
Place it here.

386
00:24:49,791 --> 00:24:50,791
That's all?

387
00:24:51,833 --> 00:24:53,208
There's more.
- What?

388
00:24:53,583 --> 00:24:55,208
There's more.

389
00:24:55,583 --> 00:24:57,541
There's more.
- There's more? Go get it.

390
00:25:08,250 --> 00:25:10,250
What is this, Papa?
A gangster's den?

391
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,250
I have only seen you running
around for mom's treatment

392
00:25:24,291 --> 00:25:25,625
during your entire young age.

393
00:25:26,583 --> 00:25:28,375
But mom didn't bring
it upon herself.

394
00:25:31,708 --> 00:25:34,875
All I remember is the hospital,
and the smell of so many medicines.

395
00:25:35,791 --> 00:25:38,416
After some time, I would
also reach that age of yours.

396
00:25:39,416 --> 00:25:40,750
If you smoke so much,

397
00:25:41,375 --> 00:25:42,625
and get some disease,

398
00:25:42,666 --> 00:25:44,458
you want me to run around
like you did then?

399
00:25:44,458 --> 00:25:45,458
Open your mouth.

400
00:25:52,375 --> 00:25:53,375
Papa...

401
00:25:53,625 --> 00:25:57,125
I'm going to Canada and trying
to get a good job there,

402
00:25:57,166 --> 00:25:59,000
not because I like to
stay away from you.

403
00:26:02,041 --> 00:26:05,125
Shouldn't we live peacefully after
clearing all our debts, Papa?

404
00:26:07,875 --> 00:26:09,041
Stand by me, please.

405
00:26:15,166 --> 00:26:16,166
Hey...

406
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:21,166
Can I smoke a cigarette,
one last time?

407
00:26:45,333 --> 00:26:48,041
Quitting smoking
is not a problem.

408
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:50,875
But still, let me
ask you something.

409
00:26:50,916 --> 00:26:51,916
Ask me.

410
00:26:52,666 --> 00:26:53,666
Every day...

411
00:26:54,291 --> 00:26:55,750
after dinner...

412
00:26:56,166 --> 00:26:57,791
.. one cigarette?
Is there a problem?

413
00:26:59,583 --> 00:27:00,833
You will never learn, huh?

414
00:27:04,208 --> 00:27:06,416
If you say no, it's fine.
But it's...

415
00:27:33,041 --> 00:27:34,250
Dude, come fast.

416
00:27:34,708 --> 00:27:37,375
You Christians hog on
chicken and beef, right?

417
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:38,500
And you still can't?

418
00:27:38,583 --> 00:27:41,666
Look at me, being so cool,
despite being a pure vegetarian.

419
00:27:42,833 --> 00:27:44,000
Yeah right.
Look at you!

420
00:27:44,041 --> 00:27:46,458
Coldness doesn't differentiate
between Hindu or Christian.

421
00:27:46,458 --> 00:27:48,000
It's a total frozen feeling.

422
00:27:50,875 --> 00:27:52,125
Hey! One second.

423
00:27:52,166 --> 00:27:53,458
Hello!
- Hello!

424
00:27:53,791 --> 00:27:54,791
Are you leaving?

425
00:27:54,958 --> 00:27:56,708
Be cool and deal with it.
- Hello?

426
00:27:56,708 --> 00:27:59,291
If I be cool anymore, I'll turn into ice.
- One second.

427
00:28:03,541 --> 00:28:04,958
Can you hear me now?
- Yes.

428
00:28:05,125 --> 00:28:06,458
Why couldn't I reach you earlier?

429
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:07,833
I was busy here.

430
00:28:08,458 --> 00:28:09,958
I will also say
this from tomorrow.

431
00:28:10,083 --> 00:28:11,083
Huh?
Got it?

432
00:28:11,125 --> 00:28:12,125
Got it.

433
00:28:12,125 --> 00:28:14,541
But the posting is in Chennai.
I have to leave tomorrow itself.

434
00:28:14,583 --> 00:28:15,583
Is it?
- Well...

435
00:28:15,583 --> 00:28:16,916
If you're sad, I won't go.

436
00:28:16,916 --> 00:28:19,541
I'm not sad at all.
I will leave early today.

437
00:28:19,666 --> 00:28:20,666
Why?

438
00:28:20,958 --> 00:28:21,958
Don't you want to meet?

439
00:28:23,375 --> 00:28:24,375
I want to...

440
00:28:24,458 --> 00:28:25,625
Any problem?

441
00:28:26,166 --> 00:28:27,166
No problem.

442
00:28:27,750 --> 00:28:28,916
Come and pick me up then.

443
00:28:30,416 --> 00:28:31,916
Okay. I will come.
- Bye.

444
00:28:32,333 --> 00:28:33,333
Dude, let's go.

445
00:28:33,541 --> 00:28:35,625
Aren't you coming?
- You drive. I'll come.

446
00:28:35,750 --> 00:28:37,125
Dude, do you have any perfume?

447
00:28:37,833 --> 00:28:39,625
What will you do after
going back home early?

448
00:28:39,625 --> 00:28:40,666
Helen, you know, right?

449
00:28:40,708 --> 00:28:42,375
It's been only six months
since I got married.

450
00:28:42,458 --> 00:28:44,333
Do I go home early from here,
at least one day?

451
00:28:44,958 --> 00:28:47,875
I leave only after all of you leave,
and after closing this shop.

452
00:28:47,916 --> 00:28:49,375
Do I take leave on any Sunday?

453
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:51,083
No.
You know why?

454
00:28:51,125 --> 00:28:52,416
Commitment towards Chicken Hub.

455
00:28:52,625 --> 00:28:55,083
My commitment towards the Hub.
None of you have that.

456
00:28:55,208 --> 00:28:56,333
Do whatever you want.

457
00:28:56,625 --> 00:28:58,375
Go.
- Thank you, sir. See you tomorrow.

458
00:29:00,083 --> 00:29:01,083
Go! Go!

459
00:29:03,666 --> 00:29:05,125
What happened?

460
00:29:05,166 --> 00:29:08,250
If I have to leave 2 hours early, I have
to hear his speech for half an hour.

461
00:29:08,750 --> 00:29:10,000
Well, how is he going tomorrow?

462
00:29:10,166 --> 00:29:11,250
By bus, he said.

463
00:29:11,375 --> 00:29:13,875
Do one thing.
You take him to the bus stop yourself.

464
00:29:13,916 --> 00:29:15,666
Otherwise, he'll go
to play from there.

465
00:29:16,083 --> 00:29:18,333
No, Chechi.
I think he has become more sensible now.

466
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:20,750
Chechi, shall I leave?

467
00:29:20,750 --> 00:29:21,916
Or I'll get late.
- Okay.

468
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:35,500
Hey!

469
00:29:36,208 --> 00:29:37,416
I'm leaving tomorrow.

470
00:29:40,166 --> 00:29:41,166
I know.

471
00:29:46,041 --> 00:29:48,833
Hey! They said that jobs in
Chennai pay really well.

472
00:29:50,166 --> 00:29:52,708
If you join some hospital there,
then Canada...

473
00:29:52,708 --> 00:29:54,291
I needn't go to Canada, right?
- Yes.

474
00:29:55,750 --> 00:29:56,750
I will go.

475
00:29:59,208 --> 00:30:00,541
So that's your decision?

476
00:30:01,625 --> 00:30:04,000
Then I'll tell my mom,
and look for some other girl.

477
00:30:04,250 --> 00:30:05,500
Pray really well.

478
00:30:10,916 --> 00:30:12,333
Will you marry some other girl?
- Yes, I will.

479
00:30:12,791 --> 00:30:14,708
I will marry.
- For sure? - Yes.

480
00:30:15,583 --> 00:30:18,166
Why? - Then I'll go to Canada,
only after your wedding.

481
00:30:18,208 --> 00:30:20,791
What? - I'm going to Canada
only after attending your wedding.

482
00:30:21,041 --> 00:30:22,625
Even if I have to barge in,
I will come.

483
00:30:23,041 --> 00:30:24,041
Go!

484
00:30:42,416 --> 00:30:43,416
Stop! Stop!

485
00:30:43,750 --> 00:30:45,333
Stop! Stop!
Stop there.

486
00:30:49,833 --> 00:30:51,291
Stop there, ahead.

487
00:30:52,208 --> 00:30:53,208
Sir, please do something.

488
00:30:53,458 --> 00:30:55,416
Please do what?
- Where's your helmet, son?

489
00:30:55,458 --> 00:30:56,666
I didn't take it, sir.

490
00:30:56,708 --> 00:30:57,708
Then get down.

491
00:30:58,750 --> 00:30:59,750
Get down.

492
00:31:03,666 --> 00:31:04,708
Come.

493
00:31:05,083 --> 00:31:06,250
Will it be a problem?
- No.

494
00:31:06,250 --> 00:31:07,250
You stay there, dear.

495
00:31:07,583 --> 00:31:09,291
Rs. 100 won't do.
- I don't have money, sir.

496
00:31:09,333 --> 00:31:10,750
Sir, he doesn't have a helmet.

497
00:31:12,625 --> 00:31:13,958
Where are you going
in the night?

498
00:31:14,416 --> 00:31:15,916
To drop her home...

499
00:31:19,333 --> 00:31:20,333
Who's that?

500
00:31:23,166 --> 00:31:25,125
If it's a case you can't
talk about, you needn't.

501
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:27,833
You were roaming at night
without a helmet, right?

502
00:31:28,125 --> 00:31:29,375
Pay the petty case fine and go.

503
00:31:30,250 --> 00:31:31,416
You tell me.

504
00:31:31,416 --> 00:31:32,750
200 Rupees, sir...

505
00:31:32,791 --> 00:31:35,375
If you drink & drive,
the law is different.

506
00:31:35,750 --> 00:31:37,291
This is all I have, sir.
- That's all?

507
00:31:37,333 --> 00:31:38,625
That's all, sir.
I swear.

508
00:31:39,125 --> 00:31:40,416
Nothing more, sir.
- Then go.

509
00:31:40,458 --> 00:31:41,791
Shall I get the key, sir?
- Yes.

510
00:31:42,166 --> 00:31:43,250
Hop on, quickly.

511
00:31:43,666 --> 00:31:45,458
Stop staring and hop on.
Let's go.

512
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:46,750
Hop on!
- Hey!

513
00:31:48,208 --> 00:31:49,208
Wait.

514
00:31:53,083 --> 00:31:54,291
Azhar, I'm getting late.

515
00:32:10,083 --> 00:32:11,583
Hey! Get that thing.
- Sir.

516
00:32:15,250 --> 00:32:16,250
Blow into it.

517
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:20,500
Blow into it.

518
00:32:27,375 --> 00:32:28,375
It struck!

519
00:32:29,125 --> 00:32:30,416
Dear, do you want to blow?

520
00:32:30,708 --> 00:32:33,083
If you drink and ride pillion,
there's no law to catch you.

521
00:32:33,250 --> 00:32:34,375
But I was just asking...

522
00:32:35,708 --> 00:32:37,208
Do the necessary things...

523
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:42,500
Where is your house?

524
00:32:42,833 --> 00:32:43,833
Changambuzha Nagar.

525
00:32:43,875 --> 00:32:45,375
Where?
- Changambuzha Nagar.

526
00:32:45,666 --> 00:32:47,375
Tell him your dad's number.
- Sir...

527
00:32:47,416 --> 00:32:48,625
No need, sir.
Please.

528
00:32:49,666 --> 00:32:50,791
Aren't we going, man?

529
00:32:51,125 --> 00:32:53,083
If we leave this girl
alone at midnight,

530
00:32:53,166 --> 00:32:54,541
and something happens to her,

531
00:32:54,583 --> 00:32:56,250
wouldn't I be blamed?
- Sir, please. Don't charge a case.

532
00:32:56,291 --> 00:32:57,291
Shut up!

533
00:32:57,500 --> 00:32:58,500
Give him the number.

534
00:33:01,958 --> 00:33:05,041
Sir, should we create a
problem, informing her family?

535
00:33:05,166 --> 00:33:06,375
It's very close-by, right?

536
00:33:06,375 --> 00:33:08,333
Why don't we send her
in an auto rickshaw?

537
00:33:08,916 --> 00:33:11,333
If she can roam around with
guys like him at midnight,

538
00:33:11,333 --> 00:33:13,958
she won't have a problem in getting
into this police jeep with us too.

539
00:33:14,583 --> 00:33:16,000
There's a lady constable, right?

540
00:33:16,666 --> 00:33:18,166
Let her family know it, man!

541
00:33:19,833 --> 00:33:21,083
Aren't you done?
- Yes, sir.

542
00:33:21,166 --> 00:33:22,166
Get in.

543
00:33:23,791 --> 00:33:25,208
Give me your license.

544
00:33:25,958 --> 00:33:26,958
Here, sir.

545
00:33:27,541 --> 00:33:28,666
Isn't it this address?

546
00:33:29,125 --> 00:33:30,666
Yes, sir.
- Then say it.

547
00:33:30,750 --> 00:33:31,833
Azhar Mohammed.

548
00:33:32,125 --> 00:33:33,125
Sir, tea.

549
00:33:33,333 --> 00:33:35,125
Give a tea to that stoner guy too.

550
00:33:35,875 --> 00:33:37,958
Tell me, son.
- Ameera Manzil...

551
00:33:38,041 --> 00:33:39,458
Ashoka Road...

552
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:40,500
No tea for me, sir?

553
00:33:40,541 --> 00:33:41,541
Do you want one?

554
00:33:41,625 --> 00:33:42,708
No!!

555
00:33:43,666 --> 00:33:45,375
Is your house close
to that school?

556
00:33:45,541 --> 00:33:47,416
No, sir.
Just before Elamakkara.

557
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,041
What does your father do?

558
00:33:49,333 --> 00:33:50,416
My father is no more.

559
00:33:50,458 --> 00:33:52,250
Who all are at home?
- Me and mom.

560
00:33:52,625 --> 00:33:53,625
Tell me your number.

561
00:33:53,750 --> 00:33:55,375
It's 854...

562
00:34:02,333 --> 00:34:04,416
Son... Tell me the rest of the number.

563
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:06,583
Shouldn't I write this?
- 854...

564
00:34:06,875 --> 00:34:07,875
77...

565
00:34:08,708 --> 00:34:09,708
26...

566
00:34:10,125 --> 00:34:12,125
Sir, I was called here.

567
00:34:12,166 --> 00:34:13,708
Who are you?
- My daughter...

568
00:34:13,958 --> 00:34:15,083
Come!

569
00:34:15,958 --> 00:34:16,958
Sir...

570
00:34:17,416 --> 00:34:18,708
That girl's father has come.

571
00:34:19,291 --> 00:34:20,333
Ask him to come.

572
00:34:29,333 --> 00:34:30,333
Please come.

573
00:34:38,083 --> 00:34:39,833
Sir, my daughter...

574
00:34:39,958 --> 00:34:41,625
Hey! There's no problem.
Please sit.

575
00:34:42,791 --> 00:34:43,958
Dear, come here.

576
00:34:44,833 --> 00:34:45,833
Come!

577
00:34:47,375 --> 00:34:48,458
Sit down, dear.

578
00:34:51,083 --> 00:34:52,083
Do you know him?

579
00:34:55,875 --> 00:34:56,875
No, sir.

580
00:34:59,208 --> 00:35:00,833
So it's without the
family's knowledge!

581
00:35:01,708 --> 00:35:02,708
She was with him.

582
00:35:03,875 --> 00:35:05,625
Actually, we needn't
interfere in this.

583
00:35:06,125 --> 00:35:08,916
But we are responsible about
the girls in our city.

584
00:35:09,333 --> 00:35:10,666
Why?
Isn't that right?

585
00:35:14,416 --> 00:35:16,041
Not me.
It's him.

586
00:35:16,166 --> 00:35:17,458
That's the mad guy, sir.

587
00:35:17,708 --> 00:35:18,916
Let him lie there.

588
00:35:19,416 --> 00:35:20,666
So what I'm saying is that...

589
00:35:21,041 --> 00:35:24,041
like advising college kids...

590
00:35:24,625 --> 00:35:26,416
we don't have to advise them.

591
00:35:26,791 --> 00:35:28,291
Because they are
working people...

592
00:35:28,541 --> 00:35:30,041
Right?
But still, listen dear...

593
00:35:30,916 --> 00:35:33,291
When you jump into such
shady relationships,

594
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:36,250
minimum, it should be with someone
with a sense of responsibility.

595
00:35:36,958 --> 00:35:39,708
Because you have to live with guys
like him in the future, right?

596
00:35:40,041 --> 00:35:41,750
Well.. If that's the case...

597
00:35:43,791 --> 00:35:46,833
So I just called you, so that the
family is aware of all this.

598
00:35:47,166 --> 00:35:49,041
Okay.
- There's no other problem.

599
00:35:49,833 --> 00:35:50,833
Okay then.

600
00:35:53,166 --> 00:35:54,291
Okay, sir.
- Okay.

601
00:37:00,208 --> 00:37:01,208
Papa...

602
00:37:52,666 --> 00:37:55,458
Sir, tickets are available
from next month 20th onwards.

603
00:37:56,458 --> 00:37:59,375
Since it's the season, fares are
slightly higher. You're flexible, right?

604
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,833
She wants to leave immediately.
Don't delay it any further.

605
00:38:02,875 --> 00:38:04,666
Book for the very next day available.
- Okay.

606
00:38:04,875 --> 00:38:05,875
Anything else?
- No.

607
00:38:11,333 --> 00:38:12,375
Ma'am...

608
00:38:12,625 --> 00:38:14,125
Ma'am, please...

609
00:38:21,625 --> 00:38:22,625
Papa...

610
00:38:36,875 --> 00:38:38,208
Don't you check the list now?

611
00:38:38,208 --> 00:38:41,083
No, sir. The inventory list had come.
- It had come. Then?

612
00:38:41,666 --> 00:38:42,791
What happened?

613
00:38:42,916 --> 00:38:45,291
Were you in charge of checking
the fresh stock yesterday?

614
00:38:46,125 --> 00:38:47,791
Yes, it was me and Shyam.

615
00:38:49,458 --> 00:38:51,625
A rat entered the
stock and ruined it.

616
00:38:51,791 --> 00:38:53,666
He is looking for you.

617
00:38:56,333 --> 00:38:57,333
Come, come.

618
00:38:58,083 --> 00:39:00,916
When an inspection happens,
you just have to smile like this.

619
00:39:01,583 --> 00:39:04,166
Who has to hear a mouthful from those guys?
Me!

620
00:39:05,791 --> 00:39:08,000
When a stock comes,
you have to check it.

621
00:39:08,166 --> 00:39:10,000
I've told this to you
all, a hundred times!

622
00:39:10,625 --> 00:39:11,833
Not just one or two...

623
00:39:12,041 --> 00:39:13,750
5-6 boxes were ruined!

624
00:39:14,041 --> 00:39:15,541
It's worth around 3000 Rupees!

625
00:39:16,916 --> 00:39:18,208
Will your dad bring that money?

626
00:39:20,833 --> 00:39:22,458
Why are you staring at me?
Huh?

627
00:39:22,875 --> 00:39:23,875
Why?

628
00:39:24,041 --> 00:39:26,416
I don't see this discomfort
while you ask for time off!

629
00:39:26,791 --> 00:39:28,708
If something like this
happens ever again...

630
00:39:28,958 --> 00:39:30,666
this is not how I would talk!

631
00:39:31,458 --> 00:39:32,458
Understood?

632
00:39:33,333 --> 00:39:35,250
They all come dressed up
in the morning itself!

633
00:39:43,541 --> 00:39:44,541
Come.

634
00:39:44,958 --> 00:39:45,958
Come!

635
00:40:15,708 --> 00:40:18,750
Though the counter is very busy,
never miss this!

636
00:40:19,333 --> 00:40:21,291
Rice, beans and what not!

637
00:40:21,541 --> 00:40:22,708
Mix it and stuff it in!

638
00:40:28,708 --> 00:40:30,041
I'll stand.

639
00:40:33,875 --> 00:40:34,875
Thank you.
- Okay.

640
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:38,041
Sir, your order?
- Helen...

641
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:40,916
I want to talk to you.
Come outside.

642
00:40:41,250 --> 00:40:42,250
Sir, your order?

643
00:40:43,541 --> 00:40:45,708
Helen, I need to talk to you.
Come out, I say.

644
00:40:46,083 --> 00:40:48,291
Sir, customers are waiting.
Can I get your order please?

645
00:40:48,375 --> 00:40:51,083
Helen, please. I'm leaving today.
That's why I'm saying this..

646
00:40:52,125 --> 00:40:53,291
This can't happen here...

647
00:40:53,333 --> 00:40:55,250
Can't you see customers waiting?
- Sorry, sir.

648
00:40:55,916 --> 00:40:57,791
Keep such games outside the shop.

649
00:40:58,041 --> 00:40:59,375
Her damn...
- Sorry, sir.

650
00:40:59,666 --> 00:41:00,666
Hey!

651
00:41:02,125 --> 00:41:03,375
One Coke & french fries....

652
00:41:03,416 --> 00:41:06,458
If you want to say something to your
staff, do it after us customers leave.

653
00:41:08,291 --> 00:41:09,291
Give it.

654
00:41:17,333 --> 00:41:19,166
One mega pack, and one Pepsi.

655
00:41:19,916 --> 00:41:21,625
Please wait for five minutes.
- Okay, sure.

656
00:41:24,875 --> 00:41:26,375
One zinger burger, one Pepsi.

657
00:41:26,583 --> 00:41:28,041
Is that all, sir?
- Yes.

658
00:41:37,916 --> 00:41:40,375
If he had any kind of responsibility,
would he do this?

659
00:41:42,416 --> 00:41:44,083
Don't sit like this.
Forget it.

660
00:41:46,750 --> 00:41:49,041
You are all set to go now.

661
00:41:49,041 --> 00:41:51,208
Don't think about
anything else now.

662
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,500
Dear, it's 7 PM.

663
00:41:53,541 --> 00:41:56,833
If I don't leave now, Prakashettan's
mom would create trouble. I'm leaving.

664
00:41:57,333 --> 00:41:58,333
How are you going?

665
00:41:58,625 --> 00:42:00,750
I'll take an auto rickshaw.
- Okay.

666
00:42:29,083 --> 00:42:30,083
Chechi...

667
00:42:52,958 --> 00:42:54,041
It's late.

668
00:42:54,083 --> 00:42:55,708
Aren't you leaving?
- Yes.

669
00:42:55,875 --> 00:42:57,208
I'm going then.
See you tomorrow.

670
00:42:59,791 --> 00:43:00,791
Azhar...

671
00:43:02,166 --> 00:43:03,333
Hey! Your shirt...

672
00:43:08,041 --> 00:43:09,125
Where did you reach?

673
00:43:09,125 --> 00:43:10,250
Chechi, I'm at the shop.

674
00:43:10,333 --> 00:43:11,333
At the shop?

675
00:43:11,583 --> 00:43:13,958
It's 11.45 PM.
What are you doing there?

676
00:43:16,125 --> 00:43:18,416
Chechi, Papa hasn't spoken
a word to me till now.

677
00:43:18,625 --> 00:43:19,916
I don't know how to face him.

678
00:43:20,416 --> 00:43:22,750
What's wrong in facing him?
He's your Papa, right?

679
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,833
I don't feel like
going home, Chechi.

680
00:43:25,125 --> 00:43:28,166
Hey girl! Don't speak nonsense.
Get going soon.

681
00:43:28,541 --> 00:43:30,208
Chechi, how will I face Papa?

682
00:43:30,416 --> 00:43:32,041
Hey! There won't be any problem.

683
00:43:32,083 --> 00:43:33,333
Everything will be all right.

684
00:43:33,333 --> 00:43:34,583
You go home first.

685
00:43:36,541 --> 00:43:37,833
What can I do after going home?

686
00:43:38,375 --> 00:43:40,041
She's not even letting
me touch her.

687
00:43:40,708 --> 00:43:43,875
If I go close, she would say 'tomorrow'.
Let's make it tomorrow.

688
00:43:44,541 --> 00:43:46,375
I get furious when I
hear 'tomorrow' now.

689
00:43:46,666 --> 00:43:48,041
That perfume you gave?

690
00:43:48,291 --> 00:43:49,291
I used that too.

691
00:43:49,375 --> 00:43:51,625
Sir...
- She doesn't like its smell.

692
00:43:51,625 --> 00:43:52,625
Sir...

693
00:43:52,708 --> 00:43:53,833
Keep it inside & go!

694
00:43:54,625 --> 00:43:55,625
It's the chicken.

695
00:43:55,958 --> 00:43:57,166
Not to you.
I said it here.

696
00:43:59,291 --> 00:44:00,375
Shouldn't we buy soda?

697
00:44:00,375 --> 00:44:02,500
I've arranged it from here.
Just walk.

698
00:44:03,916 --> 00:44:05,166
Get going!

699
00:44:05,541 --> 00:44:06,958
Hey! Hey!
- Oops! Caught!

700
00:44:08,250 --> 00:44:09,250
What is it?

701
00:44:09,291 --> 00:44:10,291
Nothing.
We were leaving.

702
00:44:11,166 --> 00:44:12,625
Will someone else keep this?

703
00:44:13,666 --> 00:44:15,416
I'll keep it, sir.
- Keep it in the freezer.

704
00:44:15,583 --> 00:44:16,791
Just lazing around...

705
00:44:17,500 --> 00:44:19,666
I thought he must have seen
me flicking the Pepsi.

706
00:44:20,625 --> 00:44:21,791
I said it here.

707
00:44:21,833 --> 00:44:22,958
Come fast.

708
00:44:24,666 --> 00:44:26,750
Helen, can you please keep
these boxes in the freezer?

709
00:44:26,791 --> 00:44:28,708
Otherwise, that monster won't let us go.
Please.

710
00:44:28,750 --> 00:44:30,125
It's time for me to leave.

711
00:44:30,166 --> 00:44:32,208
Helen, please.
We have an urgent plan. That's why.

712
00:44:32,291 --> 00:44:33,500
Please..
- To booze, right?

713
00:44:33,541 --> 00:44:34,541
Oh no! Who said that?

714
00:44:34,541 --> 00:44:36,541
No one said that.
Nothing like that. Please.

715
00:44:36,583 --> 00:44:37,583
Okay.

716
00:44:38,666 --> 00:44:40,625
Thank you.
- What is this? - No. I'll keep this.

717
00:44:41,791 --> 00:44:43,000
Come! Come!

718
00:44:43,791 --> 00:44:45,583
Chechi, I've kept it here.
- Come, dude.

719
00:44:45,625 --> 00:44:47,125
Oops. One second.
I didn't punch out.

720
00:44:47,125 --> 00:44:48,333
Great! Would've lost
the salary now.

721
00:44:48,375 --> 00:44:50,166
Come.
- Let's go!

722
00:44:53,916 --> 00:44:55,250
We've kept it, sir.

723
00:44:56,666 --> 00:44:58,375
I'm supposed to be a
terror at Chicken Hub.

724
00:44:58,500 --> 00:45:00,083
Only I know my situation at home!

725
00:45:08,458 --> 00:45:10,875
Her mom is crazy, dude.
That's what!

726
00:45:11,625 --> 00:45:14,208
She says that it is
some problem of mine.

727
00:45:14,708 --> 00:45:16,833
They've asked for some
motility test now.

728
00:45:16,958 --> 00:45:18,583
To check my count, dude.

729
00:45:18,583 --> 00:45:20,125
Let her make her
dad do that first.

730
00:45:23,083 --> 00:45:25,916
Dude, I'll tell you something.
I can't wait any longer.

731
00:45:26,333 --> 00:45:28,375
I have my own ways.

732
00:45:32,708 --> 00:45:33,916
I'll do something soon!

733
00:45:34,416 --> 00:45:35,583
Huh?
What problem?

734
00:45:36,208 --> 00:45:37,416
There won't be any problem!

735
00:45:37,625 --> 00:45:38,625
I will do it!

736
00:45:47,166 --> 00:45:48,583
Dude, what stuff did you buy?

737
00:45:51,916 --> 00:45:53,125
Huh?
Vodka?

738
00:45:54,041 --> 00:45:55,708
Dude, you don't know!

739
00:46:00,291 --> 00:46:01,750
They've left it open and gone!

740
00:46:02,208 --> 00:46:03,541
Dude, one second.
Let me lock it.

741
00:46:14,250 --> 00:46:16,041
Didn't you tell me that
you had some idea?

742
00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:27,125
I was punching out.
One second.

743
00:46:30,833 --> 00:46:33,041
Dude, I'm closing the shop.
I'll call you now.

744
00:46:58,916 --> 00:46:59,916
Sir?

745
00:47:00,708 --> 00:47:01,708
Sir?

746
00:47:14,875 --> 00:47:15,875
Sir!!

747
00:47:25,625 --> 00:47:26,625
I'm done, dude.

748
00:47:29,500 --> 00:47:31,583
I'm getting into the left.
The signal might get cut.

749
00:47:31,625 --> 00:47:32,625
Sir!!

750
00:47:35,750 --> 00:47:36,750
Sir!!

751
00:47:49,166 --> 00:47:51,250
Dude, the mall is closed.
We'll buy that tomorrow.

752
00:47:51,666 --> 00:47:52,958
I locked it and came out.

753
00:47:58,875 --> 00:48:00,583
Sir, please!

754
00:48:26,666 --> 00:48:29,125
Well.. Hasn't Helen reached home yet?

755
00:48:30,250 --> 00:48:31,250
Well...

756
00:48:31,708 --> 00:48:33,500
Her timings keep shifting, right?

757
00:48:33,500 --> 00:48:34,500
She will come now.

758
00:49:06,625 --> 00:49:08,250
Sir, any luggage to keep there?

759
00:49:08,333 --> 00:49:09,333
Any luggage?

760
00:49:09,625 --> 00:49:10,833
No.
- We're about to start.

761
00:49:16,375 --> 00:49:18,708
Excuse me.
- No. Haven't started yet. One second.

762
00:49:22,875 --> 00:49:25,250
I will reach there by evening.

763
00:49:45,083 --> 00:49:47,208
Prakashetta, can't you
hear the phone ringing?

764
00:49:50,250 --> 00:49:51,250
Hello uncle?

765
00:49:52,625 --> 00:49:53,916
She hasn't reached yet?

766
00:49:54,750 --> 00:49:56,791
I left a little early today, uncle.

767
00:49:58,833 --> 00:50:01,875
One second. I'll call those
guys and call you back, uncle.

768
00:50:12,125 --> 00:50:13,250
Hello?

769
00:50:13,458 --> 00:50:14,458
What is it, Chechi?

770
00:50:17,208 --> 00:50:19,583
When I left,
she was sitting in the pantry area.

771
00:50:20,166 --> 00:50:22,125
Chechi, try calling Jins or Amal.

772
00:50:22,166 --> 00:50:23,166
They would know.

773
00:50:26,291 --> 00:50:27,625
Don't you want Pepsi?

774
00:50:27,791 --> 00:50:28,791
Yes, Chechi.

775
00:50:30,500 --> 00:50:33,250
Chechi, we left early.
Helen left after that.

776
00:50:33,458 --> 00:50:34,666
Try calling sir.

777
00:50:34,833 --> 00:50:35,958
I'll call sir, then.

778
00:50:36,250 --> 00:50:37,250
Okay.

779
00:50:39,833 --> 00:50:40,833
Tomorrow, right?

780
00:50:41,291 --> 00:50:42,291
Tomorrow!

781
00:50:44,666 --> 00:50:45,666
What is it, Littu?

782
00:50:47,250 --> 00:50:48,541
Helen punched out & left.

783
00:50:48,958 --> 00:50:49,958
I also left.

784
00:50:50,458 --> 00:50:52,833
People don't decide things
after asking me, right?

785
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:54,375
And lame excuses after that!

786
00:50:55,708 --> 00:50:57,250
Sir, do you know anything?

787
00:50:57,458 --> 00:50:58,875
I don't know.
I left from the shop.

788
00:50:59,250 --> 00:51:00,750
You find out where
else she went!

789
00:51:06,416 --> 00:51:07,500
Hello uncle!

790
00:51:07,791 --> 00:51:09,416
They're saying that
she left from there.

791
00:51:11,250 --> 00:51:12,333
Is that so?

792
00:51:13,416 --> 00:51:14,750
Okay.
Let me see.

793
00:53:33,833 --> 00:53:34,916
Hello!

794
00:53:36,250 --> 00:53:37,666
Is anybody there?

795
00:53:41,166 --> 00:53:42,333
Please!

796
00:54:21,291 --> 00:54:22,416
Help!

797
00:54:31,250 --> 00:54:33,416
No. I came for a movie with him.

798
00:54:33,583 --> 00:54:34,583
No. We've left.

799
00:54:49,250 --> 00:54:51,208
Papa, I can hear a sound here.

800
00:54:51,458 --> 00:54:52,750
Dude, one minute.
I'll call you.

801
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:58,041
Come.

802
00:54:58,041 --> 00:54:59,291
There's no sound.
Come.

803
00:54:59,315 --> 00:55:14,315


804
00:57:16,583 --> 00:57:17,708
Papa!

805
00:57:21,916 --> 00:57:23,625
Papa, leave it.

806
00:59:34,583 --> 00:59:37,416
So you found out that the girl
left from the mall, right?

807
00:59:38,041 --> 00:59:39,041
Yes, sir.

808
00:59:39,583 --> 00:59:41,041
She left for her
house from there.

809
00:59:41,458 --> 00:59:42,458
That's a problem.

810
00:59:45,333 --> 00:59:48,083
You know Surabhi
textiles, near the mall?

811
00:59:48,208 --> 00:59:50,125
Our station limit
is only till there.

812
00:59:50,333 --> 00:59:53,166
Since this girl left the
mall and left for the house,

813
00:59:53,250 --> 00:59:55,416
it will be under North station's limit.
- But sir...

814
00:59:55,500 --> 00:59:56,666
I will explain.

815
00:59:56,791 --> 00:59:58,833
If we charge the case in a
different station limit,

816
00:59:58,875 --> 01:00:00,625
there will be problems
for both you and us.

817
01:00:00,833 --> 01:00:05,125
Moreover, in these places you mentioned,
they will be able to investigate better.

818
01:00:07,583 --> 01:00:08,583
So...

819
01:00:08,666 --> 01:00:09,791
Why don't you do that?

820
01:00:10,458 --> 01:00:11,500
That would be better.

821
01:00:12,791 --> 01:00:13,791
Okay.

822
01:00:16,208 --> 01:00:17,208
Hey!

823
01:00:17,250 --> 01:00:18,500
No problem, right?

824
01:00:19,791 --> 01:00:21,666
There are certain problems for that.
That's why.

825
01:00:22,833 --> 01:00:23,833
Okay.

826
01:03:07,500 --> 01:03:09,166
Helen...

827
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:12,958
Paul.
- Namaste, sir.

828
01:03:13,166 --> 01:03:14,541
Yesterday's...
- What's the case?

829
01:03:16,416 --> 01:03:17,416
You?

830
01:03:17,916 --> 01:03:20,375
He's coming daily or what?
- Sir, his daughter is missing.

831
01:03:20,833 --> 01:03:22,625
Who?
Yesterday's...?

832
01:03:23,375 --> 01:03:25,416
You must have beaten her
up after going home, huh?

833
01:03:26,375 --> 01:03:27,416
No, sir!

834
01:03:28,125 --> 01:03:29,666
Did you enquire with
everyone you know?

835
01:03:30,708 --> 01:03:32,333
I enquired everywhere
where she would go.

836
01:03:32,375 --> 01:03:33,916
I was told that she hasn't
reached any of those places.

837
01:03:34,250 --> 01:03:35,916
At what time does she
come home usually?

838
01:03:36,125 --> 01:03:38,083
Around 12 AM...

839
01:03:40,125 --> 01:03:41,875
She comes home at that time?

840
01:03:41,916 --> 01:03:43,750
Her work gets over
only by then, sir.

841
01:03:45,250 --> 01:03:46,250
What's her work?

842
01:03:49,791 --> 01:03:51,625
At Grand Mall, in Chicken Hub.

843
01:03:53,166 --> 01:03:54,166
Well...

844
01:03:54,625 --> 01:03:56,625
Did you enquire with that
boy we saw yesterday?

845
01:03:56,916 --> 01:03:57,916
No, sir...

846
01:03:58,208 --> 01:04:00,166
She doesn't have anything to
do with him, like you think.

847
01:04:00,208 --> 01:04:01,791
Don't have too much
self-confidence.

848
01:04:02,291 --> 01:04:03,708
You know how kids are these days!

849
01:04:04,583 --> 01:04:06,250
Get him that guy's details.

850
01:04:06,375 --> 01:04:07,375
Go.

851
01:04:07,750 --> 01:04:09,125
Enquire with him first.

852
01:04:10,875 --> 01:04:12,333
If you don't find her even then,

853
01:04:12,500 --> 01:04:13,500
we'll see then.

854
01:04:14,416 --> 01:04:17,125
Sir, my complaint?
- Hey! First enquire with him!

855
01:04:18,083 --> 01:04:19,666
Then whatever it is,
we'll see later.

856
01:04:19,875 --> 01:04:20,875
Okay. Go!

857
01:04:28,750 --> 01:04:30,083
Unnecessary troubles!

858
01:04:33,500 --> 01:04:34,500
What happened?

859
01:04:34,541 --> 01:04:35,958
Can't get through.
It's switched off.

860
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,375
Paul, we have his address, right?

861
01:04:38,583 --> 01:04:40,375
Why don't we go to his
house and enquire?

862
01:04:40,541 --> 01:04:41,541
But Raghavetta...

863
01:04:41,625 --> 01:04:43,833
She won't do that...
- She wouldn't have done so..

864
01:04:43,958 --> 01:04:46,500
But what if we get some
information about her?

865
01:04:47,041 --> 01:04:48,083
Shall we go?

866
01:05:20,083 --> 01:05:21,708
Who are you?
What is it?

867
01:05:22,041 --> 01:05:23,791
We wanted to meet Azhar.

868
01:05:23,833 --> 01:05:25,875
We tried calling him so many times.
Can't get through.

869
01:05:25,875 --> 01:05:26,958
He is not here.

870
01:05:27,166 --> 01:05:29,041
He got a job and went to Chennai.

871
01:05:29,083 --> 01:05:30,083
When did he leave?

872
01:05:30,500 --> 01:05:32,208
By tonight's bus.

873
01:05:32,250 --> 01:05:33,791
Did he say anything
in particular?

874
01:05:34,333 --> 01:05:35,791
He didn't say anything.

875
01:05:36,666 --> 01:05:37,666
What is it?

876
01:05:38,500 --> 01:05:39,791
Is there any problem?

877
01:05:40,166 --> 01:05:41,916
No.
There's no problem.

878
01:05:43,708 --> 01:05:45,083
In case he calls...

879
01:05:45,541 --> 01:05:47,375
ask him to call on this number,
without fail.

880
01:05:52,083 --> 01:05:55,000
Whenever he calls, don't forget
to give him this number. - Okay.

881
01:05:55,458 --> 01:05:57,500
Whose name should I tell him?
- Just say Paul came.

882
01:05:57,500 --> 01:05:58,500
Azhar knows.

883
01:06:02,083 --> 01:06:03,083
Okay then.

884
01:06:08,916 --> 01:06:09,916
Shall we go?

885
01:06:44,583 --> 01:06:45,583
It's nothing!

886
01:06:47,416 --> 01:06:49,416
It's a slight dislocation.
Nothing to worry.

887
01:06:58,208 --> 01:06:59,208
It's done, okay?

888
01:06:59,500 --> 01:07:00,500
Okay?

889
01:07:10,791 --> 01:07:11,791
Over here.

890
01:07:18,625 --> 01:07:20,250
Did you get any information?
- No.

891
01:07:20,750 --> 01:07:23,208
We can't get through
to that Azhar guy too.

892
01:07:23,666 --> 01:07:27,250
She told me that he got a job
in Chennai and was going there.

893
01:07:30,541 --> 01:07:33,458
Paul, shall we go to the
police station once again?

894
01:07:38,375 --> 01:07:39,375
Who is it?

895
01:07:39,375 --> 01:07:41,333
It's from that guy's number.
- Pick up.

896
01:07:41,916 --> 01:07:43,250
Hello? Hello?

897
01:07:43,958 --> 01:07:45,416
Oops. The call got disconnected.

898
01:07:45,583 --> 01:07:46,916
Call back on that number.

899
01:08:07,125 --> 01:08:08,666
Where is my daughter?

900
01:08:09,041 --> 01:08:10,041
I don't know.

901
01:08:10,250 --> 01:08:11,416
Where is my daughter?

902
01:08:11,458 --> 01:08:12,625
I don't know!

903
01:08:12,666 --> 01:08:13,958
Leave him, uncle.
- Tell me!

904
01:08:14,458 --> 01:08:16,166
Where is my daughter?
- I don't know!

905
01:08:16,166 --> 01:08:17,208
Leave him.
- Where is she?

906
01:08:17,416 --> 01:08:18,416
Listen to me.

907
01:08:18,458 --> 01:08:19,791
Move.
- Don't let him go!

908
01:08:19,833 --> 01:08:21,416
Come here.
- He knows!

909
01:08:21,416 --> 01:08:22,958
He knows where my daughter is.

910
01:08:23,833 --> 01:08:24,833
Leave me!

911
01:08:25,083 --> 01:08:27,541
How many times do I tell you
that I don't know where she is!

912
01:08:28,625 --> 01:08:30,083
Doesn't she leave
with you usually?

913
01:08:30,083 --> 01:08:32,125
I left early today.

914
01:08:32,625 --> 01:08:34,833
Jins said that those guys left first.

915
01:08:35,041 --> 01:08:38,125
When I called the manager, he said
that she has punched out & left.

916
01:08:38,333 --> 01:08:40,500
Where has this girl gone?

917
01:08:40,875 --> 01:08:42,333
Littu...!!
- Yes?

918
01:08:43,875 --> 01:08:46,125
Dear, we don't have
any time to waste.

919
01:08:46,333 --> 01:08:48,666
I don't believe what
he's saying, at all.

920
01:08:49,291 --> 01:08:51,958
We'll go to the police station with him,
immediately.

921
01:08:52,208 --> 01:08:53,208
Paul!

922
01:08:53,250 --> 01:08:54,250
Let's go to the station.

923
01:08:54,875 --> 01:08:55,875
Hey!

924
01:08:55,916 --> 01:08:56,916
Come & get into the car.

925
01:09:03,166 --> 01:09:04,166
Start the car.

926
01:10:38,083 --> 01:10:39,083
Sir...

927
01:10:39,125 --> 01:10:40,125
Sir...

928
01:10:45,291 --> 01:10:46,291
What is it?

929
01:10:46,375 --> 01:10:48,750
Sir, those people who came earlier?
That missing case?

930
01:10:49,708 --> 01:10:51,041
Sir, they have brought him.

931
01:10:51,125 --> 01:10:52,458
But the girl isn't with him.

932
01:10:52,708 --> 01:10:54,958
I will take an hour to reach there.
Ask them to wait.

933
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:58,250
Sir, one hour is a long time, right?

934
01:10:58,333 --> 01:10:59,791
Just do what I say!

935
01:11:00,666 --> 01:11:01,875
Sir...
Sir...

936
01:11:02,208 --> 01:11:04,000
Please give me the phone.
I'll talk to him.

937
01:11:06,250 --> 01:11:08,666
Sir, how can you speak
so irresponsibly?

938
01:11:09,916 --> 01:11:11,375
It's past 2 AM now.

939
01:11:11,583 --> 01:11:13,708
Why are you making us run
around here and there?

940
01:11:13,791 --> 01:11:14,791
Hey! Hey!

941
01:11:14,875 --> 01:11:17,875
Shouting at others, without
raising your child well?

942
01:11:18,166 --> 01:11:20,833
I will come after one hour,
and I will enquire if I feel like it!

943
01:11:20,958 --> 01:11:22,666
You heard me?
Hang up!

944
01:11:27,083 --> 01:11:28,708
He is a peculiar character.

945
01:11:29,041 --> 01:11:32,375
Go directly to the houses
you called earlier, and enquire.

946
01:11:32,458 --> 01:11:34,333
All those problems
happened yesterday, right?

947
01:11:34,375 --> 01:11:36,041
What if she stayed
away because of that?

948
01:11:36,083 --> 01:11:38,916
Her friends might not say the truth
if you speak over the phone.

949
01:11:39,416 --> 01:11:42,166
Sir, she won't go like that...
- You don't speak a word!

950
01:11:42,416 --> 01:11:44,791
You are the one who caused
all these problems!

951
01:11:45,208 --> 01:11:46,208
Paul...

952
01:11:46,250 --> 01:11:47,500
Come, let's find out.

953
01:11:48,125 --> 01:11:49,416
Walk...
Get into the car.

954
01:11:49,440 --> 01:12:04,440


955
01:16:26,833 --> 01:16:29,916
Uncle, when I called Helen in the morning,
I felt that she was upset.

956
01:16:30,250 --> 01:16:32,291
She didn't tell me why,
when I asked.

957
01:16:33,208 --> 01:16:34,750
I am still with them.

958
01:16:35,583 --> 01:16:37,291
That right turn
from the junction?

959
01:16:37,333 --> 01:16:39,166
No. Not there.
- She didn't call after that?

960
01:16:39,333 --> 01:16:40,791
No. She didn't call after that.

961
01:16:55,166 --> 01:16:56,166
Here.

962
01:16:59,791 --> 01:17:00,791
Your...

963
01:17:01,291 --> 01:17:02,791
I don't know what your intention is.

964
01:17:04,250 --> 01:17:06,708
We enquired everywhere
she could have gone.

965
01:17:08,291 --> 01:17:09,291
Now...

966
01:17:09,375 --> 01:17:10,375
I...

967
01:17:11,083 --> 01:17:13,166
I'm asking because I don't
have any other option.

968
01:17:14,291 --> 01:17:15,875
Your marriage or...

969
01:17:16,666 --> 01:17:18,041
whatever...
I'll get it done!

970
01:17:19,916 --> 01:17:22,208
Where is my daughter?
- What are you saying?

971
01:17:22,250 --> 01:17:24,458
Didn't you say that she called to remind
you to have medicines even tonight?

972
01:17:24,500 --> 01:17:26,041
Do you think such a person
would leave like this?

973
01:17:27,958 --> 01:17:30,083
She never wished for
us to meet like this.

974
01:17:30,833 --> 01:17:32,083
It was me who ruined all that.

975
01:17:33,958 --> 01:17:37,000
She's not a girl who'd forget the 25
years you raised her, within one night!

976
01:17:38,500 --> 01:17:40,208
You shouldn't be
looking for her here.

977
01:17:41,208 --> 01:17:42,500
Something else has happened.

978
01:17:50,666 --> 01:17:52,000
Shibin, what happened?
- Dude...

979
01:17:52,208 --> 01:17:54,166
I asked at the night shop.
They haven't seen her.

980
01:17:54,208 --> 01:17:57,083
And we checked all the nearby lanes,
and places she could have gone.

981
01:17:57,250 --> 01:17:58,458
She hasn't gone there.

982
01:17:58,500 --> 01:18:00,291
Dude, what about the Church?

983
01:18:00,333 --> 01:18:01,833
No. She hasn't gone
to the Church.

984
01:18:02,083 --> 01:18:03,833
Something serious has happened.

985
01:18:06,291 --> 01:18:08,250
Otherwise she would at
least pick up her phone.

986
01:18:10,750 --> 01:18:12,208
Hello?
- Yes, sir.

987
01:18:12,791 --> 01:18:14,041
We will come there right now.

988
01:18:14,458 --> 01:18:15,458
Okay.

989
01:18:15,500 --> 01:18:17,208
Who is it?
- It's from the station.

990
01:18:17,458 --> 01:18:18,458
Shall we go?

991
01:18:18,583 --> 01:18:19,583
Let's go.

992
01:18:29,416 --> 01:18:30,416
Raghavetta...

993
01:18:32,083 --> 01:18:35,291
She has a friend who keeps
calling her regularly.

994
01:18:35,333 --> 01:18:36,333
Shahina.

995
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:38,083
What if she went there?

996
01:18:38,166 --> 01:18:39,166
Is it?

997
01:18:39,208 --> 01:18:40,208
Who's that?

998
01:18:41,875 --> 01:18:43,000
Son...

999
01:18:43,166 --> 01:18:44,458
Do you know her number?

1000
01:18:45,208 --> 01:18:46,375
Don't bother find that.

1001
01:18:48,291 --> 01:18:49,416
That was me only.

1002
01:21:50,208 --> 01:21:57,041
'Did the flame of life flicker
in an invisible wind?'

1003
01:21:57,583 --> 01:22:04,708
'Did the heart skip a beat in anxiety?'

1004
01:22:04,916 --> 01:22:12,041
'A star that was hidden
in a snow covered corner'

1005
01:22:12,375 --> 01:22:19,541
'Waited for tomorrow's sky'

1006
01:22:19,625 --> 01:22:26,166
'There are many long paths ahead'

1007
01:22:26,250 --> 01:22:33,833
'Who is here, to guide with directions?'

1008
01:22:34,333 --> 01:22:41,000
'The path that can be seen with
the inner eye is the last resort'

1009
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:49,708
'Even when the cold breeze blows through
the veins, someone is standing guard'

1010
01:22:56,750 --> 01:23:03,791
'Did the flame of life flicker
in an invisible wind?'

1011
01:23:04,083 --> 01:23:11,000
'Did the heart skip a beat in anxiety?'

1012
01:23:11,500 --> 01:23:18,583
'A star that was hidden
in a snow covered corner'

1013
01:23:18,791 --> 01:23:25,333
'Waited for tomorrow's sky'

1014
01:23:34,750 --> 01:23:37,291
Sir, she usually goes to the
Church, after leaving the mall.

1015
01:23:37,375 --> 01:23:38,708
But she hasn't gone there today.

1016
01:23:38,875 --> 01:23:40,875
So something might have
happened between that.

1017
01:23:41,333 --> 01:23:44,541
If we call the cyber cell, won't
we be able to track the location?

1018
01:23:46,833 --> 01:23:47,833
That's true!

1019
01:23:48,708 --> 01:23:50,041
As if we didn't know that.

1020
01:23:50,125 --> 01:23:51,250
No. C.I. Sir is not here.

1021
01:23:51,916 --> 01:23:53,083
Call after half an hour.

1022
01:23:53,958 --> 01:23:55,583
If things were so easy,

1023
01:23:55,750 --> 01:23:58,541
why didn't you go straight to the
cyber cell, without coming here?

1024
01:23:59,500 --> 01:24:00,625
I was just asking, sir.

1025
01:24:02,125 --> 01:24:03,750
Well, didn't she call you?

1026
01:24:04,250 --> 01:24:05,750
You are her lover, right?

1027
01:24:07,416 --> 01:24:08,500
What happened?
Had a fight?

1028
01:24:10,791 --> 01:24:12,416
When they contacted you earlier,

1029
01:24:12,458 --> 01:24:13,833
they didn't get you.
What happened?

1030
01:24:13,833 --> 01:24:15,166
I was going to Chennai.

1031
01:24:15,625 --> 01:24:17,750
What's in Chennai?
- I got a job there.

1032
01:24:18,166 --> 01:24:19,375
You had gone to Chennai,

1033
01:24:19,458 --> 01:24:20,666
but how come you're here now?

1034
01:24:26,041 --> 01:24:27,333
What did you say your name was?

1035
01:24:27,375 --> 01:24:28,375
Azhar.

1036
01:24:29,083 --> 01:24:30,708
Sir, he...

1037
01:24:33,041 --> 01:24:34,333
Your name is Azhar...

1038
01:24:35,125 --> 01:24:36,708
The girl's name is Helen...

1039
01:24:38,333 --> 01:24:39,916
You both are in love.

1040
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:49,291
You, who went to Chennai, got a
sudden revelation and came back here.

1041
01:24:49,666 --> 01:24:51,291
Taking initiative
for the search.

1042
01:24:52,666 --> 01:24:54,916
Totally there seems to be a
spelling mistake, Azhar.

1043
01:24:55,166 --> 01:24:56,791
Sir, what are you saying?
What did I do?

1044
01:24:57,416 --> 01:24:58,416
Come.

1045
01:24:58,458 --> 01:25:00,291
Sir, I spoke to him...

1046
01:25:00,750 --> 01:25:01,750
Sit down.

1047
01:25:02,125 --> 01:25:03,125
Come.

1048
01:25:03,958 --> 01:25:05,083
Let me ask you.

1049
01:25:07,500 --> 01:25:09,583
Where is the girl?
- I don't know, sir.

1050
01:25:10,208 --> 01:25:11,958
I understood what your plan is.

1051
01:25:12,041 --> 01:25:14,791
So if you answer my
questions correctly,

1052
01:25:15,291 --> 01:25:18,208
we can all go home peacefully.

1053
01:25:18,958 --> 01:25:20,666
Sir, I don't know where she is.

1054
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:24,291
If it's difficult to say
it in front of her dad,

1055
01:25:24,583 --> 01:25:26,375
you can tell it to me in secret!

1056
01:25:26,500 --> 01:25:27,500
What are you saying, sir?

1057
01:25:29,541 --> 01:25:31,041
Or did you sell her to someone?

1058
01:25:31,083 --> 01:25:32,291
Mind your words, sir.

1059
01:25:32,458 --> 01:25:34,375
Bloody @%@%...
Where's the girl?

1060
01:25:34,583 --> 01:25:35,708
I don't know where she is!

1061
01:25:36,250 --> 01:25:38,375
Sir, please. He doesn't know.
- Move away!

1062
01:25:39,208 --> 01:25:40,750
Can't you see that
I'm questioning him?

1063
01:25:43,125 --> 01:25:45,458
Don't think you can play
a damn drama with me!

1064
01:25:46,166 --> 01:25:49,125
Troubling me at midnight...
You and your slut of a girl...

1065
01:25:49,166 --> 01:25:50,166
Sir!

1066
01:25:50,416 --> 01:25:52,666
Didn't he say that he doesn't know?
- Paul!

1067
01:25:53,250 --> 01:25:54,250
Don't...

1068
01:25:54,833 --> 01:25:56,541
Don't you dare speak ill
about my daughter!

1069
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:01,791
We came to you, because
we don't know anything!

1070
01:26:02,250 --> 01:26:03,250
Move!

1071
01:26:04,125 --> 01:26:05,916
What is it?
What's the problem?

1072
01:26:06,291 --> 01:26:09,583
Sir, he's pouncing on us saying that his
daughter is missing. Bloody... - Hey!

1073
01:26:09,625 --> 01:26:11,416
Shut up!
What's the problem?

1074
01:26:11,666 --> 01:26:14,166
Sir, it's been 4 hours since
my child went missing.

1075
01:26:14,208 --> 01:26:15,791
No investigation has
taken place so far.

1076
01:26:16,166 --> 01:26:17,958
Not even a complaint
has been registered.

1077
01:26:18,458 --> 01:26:21,708
For suggesting to enquire at cyber cell,
he bashed him up!

1078
01:26:23,208 --> 01:26:24,916
Why haven't you
registered the case?

1079
01:26:24,916 --> 01:26:25,916
Sir...

1080
01:26:26,958 --> 01:26:29,125
How many times have I told you?

1081
01:26:30,125 --> 01:26:32,000
Why can't you enquire
at the cyber cell?

1082
01:26:32,791 --> 01:26:35,208
Well, sir...
During this midnight...

1083
01:26:35,375 --> 01:26:37,458
By the time you fix a time,
if something happens to that girl,

1084
01:26:37,458 --> 01:26:38,583
who'd be responsible?

1085
01:26:39,250 --> 01:26:40,791
What's the status of her phone?

1086
01:26:40,791 --> 01:26:42,541
Sir, it's ringing, but
she isn't picking up.

1087
01:26:42,958 --> 01:26:45,375
Go call the cyber
cell and enquire!

1088
01:26:45,916 --> 01:26:47,291
Go!
- Okay, sir.

1089
01:26:48,416 --> 01:26:49,666
You please come.
Come.

1090
01:28:16,375 --> 01:28:17,458
Helen left, sir.

1091
01:28:17,500 --> 01:28:19,541
I checked the punch-out list.
Yes.

1092
01:28:19,750 --> 01:28:21,875
Then send that list to this number,
immediately.

1093
01:28:24,708 --> 01:28:27,125
In this list, it shows that
Helen has punched out.

1094
01:28:27,916 --> 01:28:30,083
So, she has left the shop.

1095
01:28:30,541 --> 01:28:33,250
But no one has seen her
reaching anywhere.

1096
01:28:38,291 --> 01:28:42,041
Did anyone have any problem with her,
or anything like that, recently?

1097
01:28:42,666 --> 01:28:44,625
No, sir.
Not to my knowledge.

1098
01:28:44,791 --> 01:28:45,791
Sir...

1099
01:28:46,416 --> 01:28:49,250
There was a problem with an auto driver,
who used to trouble her.

1100
01:28:50,625 --> 01:28:51,875
Auto driver of which stand?

1101
01:28:51,916 --> 01:28:53,666
Sir, the stand right
in front of that mall.

1102
01:28:53,708 --> 01:28:55,333
Can you identify that driver?
- Yes, sir.

1103
01:28:55,375 --> 01:28:56,375
Come.

1104
01:28:57,333 --> 01:28:58,625
Sudevan...
- Sir...

1105
01:28:59,291 --> 01:29:01,750
Pass this information to
all stations immediately.

1106
01:29:01,833 --> 01:29:05,208
And the girl's photo...
You get into the car.

1107
01:29:05,291 --> 01:29:07,750
And send the photo of the girl too.
- Yes, sir.

1108
01:29:10,500 --> 01:29:11,500
What?

1109
01:29:12,958 --> 01:29:13,958
I've sent it, sir.

1110
01:29:14,083 --> 01:29:16,375
You should call me as soon
as you get the information.

1111
01:29:16,833 --> 01:29:17,833
Okay, sir.

1112
01:29:49,375 --> 01:29:51,125
Can you stop the car?
- What happened?

1113
01:29:51,166 --> 01:29:52,458
Stop. I'll tell you.
- What?

1114
01:29:52,791 --> 01:29:54,375
Dude, stop.
They're stopping the car.

1115
01:29:57,416 --> 01:29:59,291
Firo, you can identify
that auto driver, right?

1116
01:29:59,333 --> 01:30:01,083
Yes.
- Then get down.

1117
01:30:01,291 --> 01:30:02,916
Get into the car with them.
Go.

1118
01:30:03,083 --> 01:30:04,666
Go.
- What is it, son?

1119
01:30:04,833 --> 01:30:05,833
I'll call you.

1120
01:30:05,833 --> 01:30:06,833
Dude, what's the matter?

1121
01:30:06,875 --> 01:30:09,125
Where is he going?
- Azhar?

1122
01:30:09,875 --> 01:30:10,875
Start the car.

1123
01:30:14,208 --> 01:30:15,375
Hello!
It's Azhar.

1124
01:30:15,458 --> 01:30:17,708
Jins & Amal are staying
somewhere in Girinagar, right?

1125
01:30:17,833 --> 01:30:18,958
Yes.
Why?

1126
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:20,833
Send me their numbers right away.
- Why, Azhar?

1127
01:30:38,500 --> 01:30:39,500
Sir...

1128
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:42,083
What is it?
- Sir, the phone got switched off now.

1129
01:30:42,083 --> 01:30:43,833
I'm not able to pin point
the last location.

1130
01:30:44,333 --> 01:30:45,333
You do one thing.

1131
01:30:46,625 --> 01:30:48,708
The last tower area, while the
phone got switched off.

1132
01:30:48,750 --> 01:30:49,750
Send that.

1133
01:30:49,750 --> 01:30:51,416
Okay sir.
I'll send it.

1134
01:31:49,416 --> 01:31:56,458
'Did the flame of life flicker
in an invisible wind?'

1135
01:31:56,791 --> 01:32:03,541
'Did the heart skip a beat in anxiety?'

1136
01:32:03,958 --> 01:32:10,583
'There are many long paths ahead'

1137
01:32:10,791 --> 01:32:18,375
'Who is here, to guide with directions?'

1138
01:32:36,916 --> 01:32:37,916
Sir, phone!

1139
01:32:39,708 --> 01:32:41,000
Sir, it's from the cyber cell.

1140
01:32:41,750 --> 01:32:43,000
I'm coming.

1141
01:32:45,041 --> 01:32:46,708
What is it?
- It's from the cyber cell.

1142
01:32:46,750 --> 01:32:48,458
Must be the girl's location, sir.

1143
01:32:53,875 --> 01:32:55,291
It got disconnected.
- Oh no!

1144
01:33:06,541 --> 01:33:08,125
Sir, I'm calling from the cyber cell.

1145
01:33:08,291 --> 01:33:10,500
That phone got switched
off two minutes back.

1146
01:33:11,166 --> 01:33:13,000
So we can't get the
exact location.

1147
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:14,750
The tower area while
it got switched off...

1148
01:33:20,125 --> 01:33:21,125
On WhatsApp?

1149
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:24,000
No! No!

1150
01:33:24,083 --> 01:33:25,500
I will send it to the C.I.

1151
01:33:44,458 --> 01:33:47,375
[an old Malayalam song plays]

1152
01:34:15,458 --> 01:34:16,333
Sir, it's him.

1153
01:34:16,375 --> 01:34:18,000
What's the matter?
- What is it, sir?

1154
01:34:19,125 --> 01:34:20,541
Where's that girl called Helen?

1155
01:34:20,625 --> 01:34:21,708
I don't know, sir.

1156
01:34:21,750 --> 01:34:23,208
So you don't know
where Helen is?

1157
01:34:23,250 --> 01:34:24,791
I don't know, sir.
What is this?

1158
01:34:24,875 --> 01:34:27,541
Come here. You'll say it when
we take you to the station.

1159
01:34:27,583 --> 01:34:28,791
Sir, he's a fraud, all right.

1160
01:34:28,791 --> 01:34:30,166
But he was here all day today.

1161
01:34:30,166 --> 01:34:31,458
Are you sure?
- Yes, sir.

1162
01:34:32,916 --> 01:34:34,625
Get his name & details.

1163
01:34:42,166 --> 01:34:43,166
Nawaz.

1164
01:34:43,583 --> 01:34:44,583
Where is your house?

1165
01:34:44,583 --> 01:34:45,958
At Pulleppady...
- There?

1166
01:34:46,041 --> 01:34:47,500
It's near the bridge there, sir.

1167
01:34:48,375 --> 01:34:49,375
Do you go on night rides?

1168
01:34:49,416 --> 01:34:50,791
Yes. On most nights, sir.

1169
01:35:10,833 --> 01:35:11,833
Hello?

1170
01:35:12,208 --> 01:35:13,208
Hello Ikka?

1171
01:35:13,750 --> 01:35:15,666
Where are you?
- I'm coming. Hang up.

1172
01:35:15,750 --> 01:35:16,750
Okay.

1173
01:35:20,916 --> 01:35:21,916
Chetta...

1174
01:35:22,250 --> 01:35:24,208
Hey! Didn't you say
that you left first?

1175
01:35:24,666 --> 01:35:26,458
Then how come your
punch-out is after Helen?

1176
01:35:26,500 --> 01:35:28,708
Tell me, you rascal.
- Chetta, we left first.

1177
01:35:28,750 --> 01:35:30,208
Then? - Only then we
remembered about punching out.

1178
01:35:30,208 --> 01:35:32,000
Chetta, that's the truth.
- Where was she then?

1179
01:35:32,041 --> 01:35:34,708
Chechi went to keep the stock
into the freezer. - Where?

1180
01:35:34,750 --> 01:35:36,041
In the freezer.
- Chetta...

1181
01:35:37,458 --> 01:35:38,500
Please.

1182
01:35:43,166 --> 01:35:44,958
Who is it?
- It's Ikka. Hello?

1183
01:35:45,375 --> 01:35:47,916
Firo, ask them to check the
store's freezer immediately.

1184
01:35:47,958 --> 01:35:49,250
Ikka?

1185
01:35:49,333 --> 01:35:50,458
Hello?
- Freezer!

1186
01:35:50,583 --> 01:35:51,583
Hello?
Hello?

1187
01:35:51,791 --> 01:35:53,208
What's the matter, Chetta?

1188
01:35:53,750 --> 01:35:54,833
Damn it!

1189
01:35:54,833 --> 01:35:57,250
Give me your phone. - We didn't take
phones. We came out to buy cigarettes.

1190
01:35:58,583 --> 01:35:59,583
What's the matter?

1191
01:36:20,958 --> 01:36:23,458
Sir, she has never stayed
over at her friends' places,

1192
01:36:23,458 --> 01:36:24,791
without
telling me, so far.

1193
01:36:24,833 --> 01:36:26,166
What about the CCTV footage?

1194
01:36:26,500 --> 01:36:28,875
Sir, we checked the CCTV footage
of all the nearby shops.

1195
01:36:28,916 --> 01:36:30,791
Her face hasn't been
registered in any of it.

1196
01:36:31,208 --> 01:36:32,916
What about the mall footage?

1197
01:36:32,916 --> 01:36:35,125
Sir, we can't get through
to the mall's manager.

1198
01:36:36,625 --> 01:36:37,916
What is this, man?

1199
01:36:38,083 --> 01:36:39,375
Everything is like this, huh?

1200
01:36:39,458 --> 01:36:40,958
Where does the
mall's manager stay?

1201
01:36:40,958 --> 01:36:43,333
Sir, the mall's manager is close by.

1202
01:36:43,375 --> 01:36:46,291
A little away from here.
Galaxy apartment.

1203
01:36:47,458 --> 01:36:49,416
Come.
You should be here. We'll be right back.

1204
01:36:49,416 --> 01:36:51,375
What about the cyber cell?
Any information?

1205
01:36:51,416 --> 01:36:53,291
When I called Ratheesh sir,
he said he's checking.

1206
01:36:53,291 --> 01:36:55,083
Ask him to make it fast!
- Sir...

1207
01:37:33,791 --> 01:37:36,875
Can't you send that tower
location at least now, sir?

1208
01:37:37,458 --> 01:37:38,833
C.I. Sir...

1209
01:37:39,750 --> 01:37:41,416
and that girl's dad...

1210
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:43,333
put up a great show, right?

1211
01:37:44,125 --> 01:37:45,916
Let them be out in the
cold for some time.

1212
01:37:46,125 --> 01:37:47,958
It's about a girl's life, sir!

1213
01:37:49,958 --> 01:37:50,958
I don't care!

1214
01:38:03,291 --> 01:38:04,291
Hey!

1215
01:38:05,125 --> 01:38:06,125
Where are you going?

1216
01:38:06,208 --> 01:38:07,958
I want to drink some water.

1217
01:38:09,125 --> 01:38:11,041
Water is right here.

1218
01:38:12,458 --> 01:38:13,750
Won't I give it?

1219
01:38:17,791 --> 01:38:18,791
Sit down.

1220
01:38:19,791 --> 01:38:20,791
Drink it.

1221
01:38:22,125 --> 01:38:23,125
Drink it!

1222
01:39:11,458 --> 01:39:12,541
What is it, sir?
- Hey!

1223
01:39:13,250 --> 01:39:14,291
What's happening there?

1224
01:39:15,125 --> 01:39:16,416
Open it.
- Yes, sir.

1225
01:39:17,708 --> 01:39:18,708
Move!

1226
01:39:23,791 --> 01:39:24,791
What?

1227
01:39:24,833 --> 01:39:25,833
Showing off?

1228
01:39:27,041 --> 01:39:28,041
Messing with me?

1229
01:39:34,291 --> 01:39:36,375
If you dare to show off
in front of me....

1230
01:39:42,791 --> 01:39:44,458
Yes, Sudevan..
- Hello, sir...

1231
01:39:51,291 --> 01:39:52,375
Good night.

1232
01:39:58,750 --> 01:39:59,958
Hey! Hey!

1233
01:40:01,500 --> 01:40:03,458
Slowly! Slowly!
Get up.

1234
01:40:04,708 --> 01:40:05,708
Are you okay?

1235
01:40:06,125 --> 01:40:08,208
You're bleeding a lot.
I'll take you to the hospital.

1236
01:40:08,583 --> 01:40:09,583
No! No!

1237
01:40:11,166 --> 01:40:12,166
Are you okay?

1238
01:40:17,041 --> 01:40:19,208
You are bleeding.
I'll take you to the hospital.

1239
01:40:19,541 --> 01:40:20,583
Please come.

1240
01:40:20,666 --> 01:40:21,666
Please.

1241
01:40:32,416 --> 01:40:33,583
Raghavetta...

1242
01:40:35,291 --> 01:40:37,500
Littu said that, even
after work hours,

1243
01:40:38,125 --> 01:40:41,583
she sat there itself, because she didn't
know how to face me, after coming home.

1244
01:40:43,083 --> 01:40:45,458
She tried to talk to
me so many times.

1245
01:40:46,500 --> 01:40:48,625
If I had spoken to her...

1246
01:40:49,041 --> 01:40:50,791
she would have been
with me now, right?

1247
01:40:54,041 --> 01:40:55,041
But...

1248
01:40:55,791 --> 01:40:58,083
where would my daughter be?

1249
01:40:58,583 --> 01:40:59,625
Calm down.

1250
01:41:05,333 --> 01:41:07,083
Bhai... Bhai..
You get going.

1251
01:41:07,125 --> 01:41:08,125
I'll sit here now.

1252
01:41:09,291 --> 01:41:10,833
Okay, brother.
Good night.

1253
01:41:11,208 --> 01:41:13,458
Hey! You shouldn't be standing
here in a group like this!

1254
01:41:13,500 --> 01:41:14,666
Don't say anything to them.

1255
01:41:14,833 --> 01:41:16,541
His daughter has been
missing since night.

1256
01:41:16,916 --> 01:41:18,458
Poor guy was crying.

1257
01:41:19,083 --> 01:41:21,833
Police came here,
and went to our manager's house.

1258
01:41:22,500 --> 01:41:24,458
Okay. You get going.
- Okay, brother.

1259
01:41:24,750 --> 01:41:25,750
Hey!

1260
01:41:26,708 --> 01:41:28,375
Does that girl work here?

1261
01:41:28,583 --> 01:41:30,083
Yes.
At Chicken Hub.

1262
01:41:30,333 --> 01:41:31,333
Chicken Hub?

1263
01:41:31,791 --> 01:41:33,125
Do you have her photo with you?

1264
01:41:43,583 --> 01:41:45,833
Did you enquire at every place
she might go to?

1265
01:41:49,333 --> 01:41:50,458
I think that...

1266
01:41:50,708 --> 01:41:52,291
this girl hasn't gone
out of the mall.

1267
01:42:02,500 --> 01:42:06,083
Sir, the security guard says that she
hasn't gone out from here. - Open it.

1268
01:42:06,291 --> 01:42:07,291
Open it, quickly!

1269
01:42:08,625 --> 01:42:10,166
Switch on all the lights.
- Okay, sir.

1270
01:42:11,416 --> 01:42:12,708
Where is the CCTV room?

1271
01:42:15,916 --> 01:42:22,875
'A star that was hidden
in a snow covered corner'

1272
01:42:23,333 --> 01:42:30,250
'Waited for tomorrow's sky'

1273
01:42:52,250 --> 01:42:53,875
Give me that torch light.
- Dear...

1274
01:42:55,541 --> 01:42:57,666
Hasn't the shop's manager reached?
- He said he's on the way, sir.

1275
01:42:57,750 --> 01:42:59,166
Ask him to come fast.

1276
01:42:59,458 --> 01:43:01,583
Tell him that we'll break it open,
if he doesn't reach quickly.

1277
01:43:06,375 --> 01:43:08,666
Did anyone go to check the CCTV?
- Yes, sir.

1278
01:43:12,250 --> 01:43:20,583
'Even when the cold breeze blows through
the veins, someone is standing guard'

1279
01:43:27,916 --> 01:43:34,958
'Did the flame of life flicker
in an invisible wind?'

1280
01:43:35,166 --> 01:43:42,458
'Did the heart skip a beat in anxiety?'

1281
01:43:42,625 --> 01:43:47,416
'A star that was hidden
in a snow covered corner'

1282
01:43:47,708 --> 01:43:49,000
My dear!!

1283
01:43:50,083 --> 01:43:58,083
'Waited for tomorrow's sky'

1284
01:44:36,833 --> 01:44:37,833
What is it, sir?

1285
01:44:39,000 --> 01:44:40,000
Damn it!

1286
01:45:57,500 --> 01:45:58,500
My dear...

1287
01:46:16,333 --> 01:46:21,041
'I searched all over the starry sky'

1288
01:46:21,083 --> 01:46:22,166
Papa!!

1289
01:46:25,666 --> 01:46:30,500
'Tell me, O dear cloud'

1290
01:46:30,500 --> 01:46:31,875
Come on!!

1291
01:46:34,958 --> 01:46:41,916
'Did the merciful morning
disappear in the starry sky?'

1292
01:46:41,958 --> 01:46:53,083
'Did you see my father, whom I
love more than anything in life?'

1293
01:46:54,333 --> 01:47:03,625
'O golden star, did you disappear
somewhere in this night?'

1294
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:13,625
'O sky, is the morning ray far away?'

1295
01:47:13,708 --> 01:47:22,916
'O golden star, did you disappear
somewhere in this night?'

1296
01:47:23,333 --> 01:47:32,708
'O sky, is the morning ray far away?'

1297
01:47:32,791 --> 01:47:37,375
'I searched all over the starry sky'

1298
01:47:37,916 --> 01:47:42,208
'Tell me, O dear cloud'

1299
01:48:15,541 --> 01:48:16,541
My dear...

1300
01:48:19,333 --> 01:48:20,833
My dear child...

1301
01:48:21,000 --> 01:48:22,000
Dear...

1302
01:48:23,000 --> 01:48:24,000
Move!

1303
01:48:25,166 --> 01:48:26,166
My darling!

1304
01:48:26,791 --> 01:48:27,791
My dear...

1305
01:48:28,416 --> 01:48:29,416
Move, I say!

1306
01:48:29,458 --> 01:48:31,000
My dear...

1307
01:48:32,958 --> 01:48:33,958
Dear...

1308
01:48:34,750 --> 01:48:35,750
My dear...

1309
01:48:36,291 --> 01:48:37,291
Dear...

1310
01:48:41,958 --> 01:48:44,666
My daughter is gone, sir!

1311
01:48:49,875 --> 01:48:52,000
She's gone, sir!

1312
01:48:55,000 --> 01:48:56,791
My dear child...

1313
01:49:07,000 --> 01:49:08,166
Papa!

1314
01:49:11,625 --> 01:49:12,875
Sir! Sir!

1315
01:49:13,333 --> 01:49:14,333
My daughter!

1316
01:49:15,333 --> 01:49:16,333
Lift her!

1317
01:49:16,416 --> 01:49:17,416
Lift her up, everyone!

1318
01:49:42,666 --> 01:49:43,666
Hey! The doctor is here.

1319
01:49:45,625 --> 01:49:46,875
There are complications, but...

1320
01:49:47,291 --> 01:49:48,458
there's nothing to worry now.

1321
01:49:48,625 --> 01:49:50,208
The life-threatening stage is over.

1322
01:49:50,500 --> 01:49:53,958
We're lucky that you were able to take
her out, by the time hypothermia struck.

1323
01:49:54,666 --> 01:49:57,375
Let her get better. We'll
start physiotherapy.

1324
01:49:58,708 --> 01:50:00,166
The scan is here.
- I'll come.

1325
01:50:00,750 --> 01:50:05,166
A human cannot stand in a temperature
of 17 degrees in AC, beyond a point.

1326
01:50:05,416 --> 01:50:06,708
That's when your daughter...

1327
01:50:06,875 --> 01:50:09,250
stayed for 5 hours in there,
at -18 degrees.

1328
01:50:09,500 --> 01:50:10,916
I don't know how she survived!

1329
01:50:12,250 --> 01:50:13,875
I must say, she's a strong girl.

1330
01:50:16,083 --> 01:50:17,416
Don't worry.
Stay strong.

1331
01:50:22,958 --> 01:50:24,291
Why can't you keep an alarm?

1332
01:50:24,791 --> 01:50:26,208
I don't use alarms usually, sir.

1333
01:50:26,250 --> 01:50:27,416
I wake up right on time daily.

1334
01:50:27,416 --> 01:50:29,000
It's not about you
setting an alarm.

1335
01:50:29,041 --> 01:50:30,500
it's about having an
alarm in the shop.

1336
01:50:30,500 --> 01:50:32,333
I was talking about
installing a safety alarm.

1337
01:50:32,541 --> 01:50:33,833
Sorry, sir.
I'll get it done.

1338
01:50:38,041 --> 01:50:39,500
Sir, they had called
from the cyber cell.

1339
01:50:40,416 --> 01:50:41,541
I've got the tower location.

1340
01:50:41,750 --> 01:50:42,750
Good!

1341
01:50:42,916 --> 01:50:43,958
You loser!

1342
01:50:44,125 --> 01:50:47,750
I've told you many times
not to do such shady jobs.

1343
01:50:47,750 --> 01:50:49,916
You stay there.
Don't go anywhere. I'm coming...

1344
01:50:49,958 --> 01:50:51,333
Sir, it's a hospital.

1345
01:50:51,458 --> 01:50:52,458
Hang up!

1346
01:51:19,000 --> 01:51:20,000
Sleep!

1347
01:51:21,916 --> 01:51:23,125
What's the time. Papa?

1348
01:51:23,666 --> 01:51:24,666
Don't worry.

1349
01:51:24,916 --> 01:51:26,666
I've given his
'before-food' medicines.

1350
01:51:28,583 --> 01:51:29,583
What is this?

1351
01:51:30,083 --> 01:51:32,541
A car crashed into my bike.
That's what.

1352
01:51:32,541 --> 01:51:34,083
Not that.
Didn't you go to Chennai?

1353
01:51:36,166 --> 01:51:37,166
If he had gone,

1354
01:51:37,500 --> 01:51:38,500
would he be here now.

1355
01:51:40,166 --> 01:51:41,583
Are you both friends now?

1356
01:51:45,875 --> 01:51:48,041
Is he someone whom we
can take into our kin, Papa?

1357
01:51:50,125 --> 01:51:51,125
I can adjust.

1358
01:51:58,125 --> 01:51:59,500
Did you think that I was gone?

1359
01:51:59,625 --> 01:52:00,625
No!

1360
01:52:02,750 --> 01:52:04,041
I won't go, okay?

1361
01:52:05,250 --> 01:52:06,750
I want all of you.

1362
01:52:09,750 --> 01:52:12,625
But, for nurses who work here...

1363
01:52:12,916 --> 01:52:14,791
salary is very less, I heard.

1364
01:52:15,625 --> 01:52:16,625
Right, sister?

1365
01:52:17,750 --> 01:52:19,541
We just make do somehow, sir.

1366
01:52:19,958 --> 01:52:22,625
We wish that those who're close
to us should be by our side, right?

1367
01:52:26,541 --> 01:52:27,541
So...

1368
01:52:28,708 --> 01:52:30,166
Let's do that, right?

1369
01:52:34,833 --> 01:52:35,833
Here.

1370
01:52:36,166 --> 01:52:37,166
Give it, son.

1371
01:52:37,208 --> 01:52:38,208
I'll get it.

1372
01:52:40,083 --> 01:52:41,083
I'll be right back.

1373
01:52:43,458 --> 01:52:44,541
Azhar...

1374
01:52:45,375 --> 01:52:46,375
Sit down.

1375
01:52:47,416 --> 01:52:49,375
I was going to ask you
to keep an eye on her.

1376
01:52:49,625 --> 01:52:50,875
I realized that you would.

1377
01:52:52,250 --> 01:52:53,250
I'll be right back.

1378
01:52:56,333 --> 01:52:57,708
Wait. Let him come out.

1379
01:52:58,208 --> 01:53:00,500
We'll go once Ikka comes.
You wait.

1380
01:53:04,458 --> 01:53:06,791
Where did you go, Papa?
- I went to make a call.

1381
01:53:07,333 --> 01:53:11,083
Didn't you smoke now, Papa?
- No! No way!

1382
01:53:11,125 --> 01:53:12,375
Your hand smells of cigarette.

1383
01:53:12,416 --> 01:53:13,416
Hey! I was just...

1384
01:53:13,416 --> 01:53:15,500
If you smoke again, I'll tell mom...
- Sir...

1385
01:53:17,625 --> 01:53:18,625
How is your daughter?

1386
01:53:18,833 --> 01:53:21,416
She opened her eyes. They said
that there's nothing to worry now.

1387
01:53:21,458 --> 01:53:23,250
Is it?
That's a relief, right?

1388
01:53:24,333 --> 01:53:25,333
Well...

1389
01:53:25,541 --> 01:53:28,791
How did you feel that my
child would be in there?

1390
01:53:30,375 --> 01:53:33,000
It's been around 30 years
since I started this job.

1391
01:53:33,166 --> 01:53:35,166
I see hundreds of people every day.

1392
01:53:36,291 --> 01:53:38,000
We've never spoken to
each other till now.

1393
01:53:39,125 --> 01:53:41,333
But every day, while
going in and coming out,

1394
01:53:41,500 --> 01:53:44,333
your daughter smiles at me,
without fail.

1395
01:53:44,833 --> 01:53:45,833
She waves her hand at me.

1396
01:53:46,458 --> 01:53:48,208
Yesterday, I got that
while she went in.

1397
01:53:48,333 --> 01:53:50,958
But I was sure that I didn't
get that in the evening.

1398
01:53:53,708 --> 01:53:55,208
Us, who are noticed by no one...

1399
01:53:55,416 --> 01:53:57,041
When someone notices us...

1400
01:53:57,500 --> 01:53:59,541
we never forget that
person's face, sir.

1401
01:54:02,166 --> 01:54:03,916
Actually, in today's times,

1402
01:54:04,125 --> 01:54:06,208
people should be taught
to look at faces & walk,

1403
01:54:06,208 --> 01:54:07,875
instead of looking at
the floor & walking.

1404
01:54:08,458 --> 01:54:10,041
Okay then.
I am leaving.

1405
01:54:10,333 --> 01:54:11,791
It's time for me to
get back to duty.

1406
01:54:12,041 --> 01:54:14,041
I can't stay away for too long.

1407
01:54:14,125 --> 01:54:15,125
Bye.

1408
01:54:19,458 --> 01:54:20,750
I forgot to ask.

1409
01:54:21,541 --> 01:54:23,333
What is your
daughter's name, sir?

1410
01:54:26,625 --> 01:54:27,625
HELEN
